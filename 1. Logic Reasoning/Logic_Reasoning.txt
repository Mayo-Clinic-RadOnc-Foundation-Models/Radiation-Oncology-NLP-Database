No 

23. For low-energy x-ray beams such as orthovoltage and superficial, the absorbed dose in bone is two to four times the absorbed dose in soft tissues for the same exposure because of the significant probability of the Compton [LC16]effect.
No

24. For megavoltage photon beams, the absorbed dose in bone is slightly higher [LC17]than that in soft tissue because of the predominance of the Compton effect.
No

25. All recent calibration protocols (TG-21, TG-51, and IAEA TRS-398) use Bragg-Gray cavity theory.

Yes

58. Due to normal tissue protection, the treatment beam in intensity-modulated proton therapy should take the shortest path[LC31] to reach the tumor by using multiple beam directions.

No

60. After the proton are accelerated, they are transported into the treatment room through the beamline. The proton beam that reaches the treatment room is nearly monoenergetic and has a lateral spread of only a few millimeters.
Yes

61. In general, there are two methods of lateral proton beam spreading applied in clinical treatment: passive scattering, in which low[LC32]-Z materials scatter the proton beam to the desired dimension, and magnetic beam scanning, in which magnetic fields sweep the proton beam over the desired area.
No  

62. When looking at the depth-dose curve of monoenergetic proton beam, it is obvious that the Bragg peak is too sharp to cover a target of any reasonable size. By using range modulation techniques, the Bragg peak can be transformed into a plateau to cover the target in the lateral [LC33]direction.
No

63. When considering how a proton beam can be used for clinical purposes, one must factor in both the biological and physical effects.
Yes

64. During proton treatment, the accelerator and the beam transport system transport to the patient a monoenergetic beam with a small lateral cross section.

65. The effect of proton radiation are biological, like drugs, and far less predictable than previously thought, leading to current uncertainties about the RBE of protons, which appears to vary according to beam energy, linear energy transfer, tissues, point along the Bragg peak, and fraction size.
Yes

66. In proton therapy, the elastic [LC34]collisions with nuclei, losing the primary particle and producing neutrons and proton scattered with large angles.

71. When using the rectal spacer hydrogel before proton therapy in the patients with prostate cancer, the spacer hydrogel can be simplified as water[LC37] if its CT density is close to water.
No

72. Energy deposition events associated with radiation interactions with tissues can cause damage to cellular structures such as the cell membrane and mitochondria[LC38], which is the main mechanism of interest for radiotherapy.
No

73. The LET is a macroscopic dosimetric parameter because it does not describe energy deposition in a biological target, but rather the energy deposition per path length of a particle.
Yes

74. The increase in RBE as a function of the depth in an SOBP also impacts the position of the distal dose fall-off. An increasing RBE with depth due to LET increase can lead to a shift in the dose fall-off of a few cm[CL39].
No

75. The RBE increases with increasing dose-weighted LET, which increases with increasing depth if an SOBP is being delivered. Consequently, the RBE is expected to be significantly lower [CL40]toward the distal end of an SOBP.
No

76. The proton beam intensity from the accelerator needs to be sufficient. In principle, cyclotrons and synchrotrons are accelerators capable of delivering sufficient high beam intensities.

Yes

77. Synchrocyclotrons typically deliver a continuous [CL41]beam only during 1% of the time that a normal cyclotron would provide beam.

Yes

80. While the HU are dominated by the relative electron density (RED), the translation from HU to RED is linear [CL43]and requires calibration. A typical HU-to-RED curve has two separate straight-line fits: one for HUs up to water and one for higher Hus- because of the transition from predominantly Compton effect to predominantly photoelectric effect for higher-Z materials.
No

81. Proton depth-dose profiles are measured in water for a range of proton beam energies during commissioning. For material other than water, the proton ranges are scaled by the material’s relative biological effect[CL44].
No

82. Since HU vary with multiple parameters, such as imaging beam quality, phantom size, and the material’s location within the phantom, the use of multiple calibration curves should be considered.
Yes

83. For some patients, contrast material is injected during the planning CT to aid volume segmentation. Since the contrast material is not present during treatment, it is OK to use a contrast[LC45] CT for proton planning purposes.

No

87. Task Group 142 (TG-142) of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) recommends that the coincidence of radiation and mechanical isocenter should be checked against baseline during annual Quality Assurance. The coincidence of radiation and mechanical isocenters is evaluated by star-shot [LC48]test. It captures the image of a BB phantom aligned to the lasers in a collimated radiation field measured on an Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) at various gantry and couch angles. The center of the collimated field and the center of the BB are measured and compared.
No

Yes

91. To be able to set up a multicenter machine learning environment, only one [LC50]biomedical informatics-related issue needs to be addressed. It [LC51]is semantic interoperability among participating centers. The infrastructure (both institutional and central) and privacy preservation have been [LC52]addressed and may influence the choice for a centralized or distributed approach.
No

92. The record and verification (R&V) systems are the link between the TPS and the linac: all parameters such as number of treatment fields, gantry and collimator angle, MLC positions, table position, dose and dose rate, beam quality, clinical medical electronic record,[LC53] and number of treatment sessions are transferred from the TPS to the R&V system. 
No

93. Based on quality assurance requirements, often required by law, the treatment planning [LC54]system has the role of guaranteeing the correct transfer of all geometrical und radiological data from the TPS to the linac.
No

94. In radiation oncology, probably more than in other medical specialties, the design and implementation of electronic information systems occur due to the need to reduce and eliminate human error in treatment – such as during the transfer of information from treatment planning to treatment delivery.
Yes

95. Craniospinal irradiation involves the irradiation of a large volume of tissue that includes the entire craniospinal axis. When radiation therapy to the craniospinal axis is not conformal enough, there is a potential for the irradiation of a very small [LC55]volume of normal tissue that sits anterior to the craniospinal region.
No

96. Since the life span of a cyclotron can range from thirty to fifty years, which is significantly longer that the life span of a linear accelerator, proton beam therapy is less expensive to deliver than photons.

No

99. The use of advanced imaging tools can lead to an improvement in the delineation of the target volume and adjacent normal tissues, thereby allowing the treatment planning team to better sculpt the dose that is delivered to the region of cancer while shielding nearby normal tissues from the harmful effects of radiation.
Yes

100. IMRT allows optimization of the delivered dose through inverse treatment planning so that the high-dose region better conforms to the organs-at-risk[LC57] while the treatment planning software uses a sophisticated computer planning algorithm to drive down the dose that is delivered to adjacent normal tissues.
