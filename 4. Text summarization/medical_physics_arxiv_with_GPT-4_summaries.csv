Optimization of pencil beam scanning pattern for FLASH proton therapy,"Sylvain Deffet, Edmond Sterpin","Purpose: The FLASH effect, which reduces the radiosensitivity of healthy tissue while maintaining tumor control at high dose rates, has shown potential for improving radiation therapy. Conformal FLASH proton therapy involves advanced beam-shaping technologies and specialized nozzle designs to confine the dose to the target volume. Optimizing the spot delivery pattern and range modulators can enhance the local dose rate, and genetic algorithms have been used to optimize scan patterns for stereotactic FLASH proton therapy of early-stage lung cancer and lung metastases. A fast and effective method based on graph theory is proposed to optimize the dose rate in specific regions of interest.
  Methods: We have created a graph-based algorithm to optimize the trajectory of proton spots to maximize the 100th percentile dose rate. Since this problem is NP-hard, we have employed an approximation algorithm that can solve this kind of Traveling Salesman Problem efficiently.
  Results: When compared to a conventional serpentine pattern, the optimized scanning trajectory led to a doubling of the median dose rate, but only a minor increase in DR95. Our approach is more efficient and requires fewer evaluations of the objective function and hyper-parameters compared to existing genetic algorithms. Conclusions: The optimized scanning trajectory led to a doubling of the median dose rate, but only a minor increase in DR95. The extent to which the dose rate can be increased depends on the size and shape of the region of interest. Future research could explore integrating FLASH objectives into treatment planning and incorporating the proposed method into plan optimization.",Medical Physics,"12 April, 2023",2304.05721,,"@misc{2304.05721,

Beamlet-free optimization for Monte Carlo based treatment planning in proton therapy,"D. Pross, S. Wuyckens, S. Deffet, E. Sterpin, J. A. Lee, K. Souris","Background: Dose calculation and optimization algorithms in proton therapy treatment planning often have high computational requirements regarding time and memory. This can hinder the implementation of efficient workflows in clinics and prevent the use of new, elaborate treatment techniques aiming to improve clinical outcomes like robust optimization, arc and adaptive proton therapy. Purpose: A new method, namely, the beamlet-free algorithm, is presented to address the aforementioned issue by combining Monte Carlo dose calculation and optimization into a single algorithm and omitting the calculation of the time-consuming and costly dose influence matrix. Methods: The beamlet-free algorithm simulates the dose in proton batches of randomly chosen spots and evaluates their relative impact on the objective function at each iteration. Based on the approximated gradient, the spot weights are then updated and used to generate a new spot probability distribution. The beamlet-free method is compared against a conventional, beamlet-based treatment planning algorithm on a brain case. Results: The beamlet-free algorithm maintained a comparable plan quality while reducing the computation time by 70% and the peak memory usage by 95%. Conclusion: The implementation of a beamlet-free treatment planning algorithm for proton therapy is feasible and capable of achieving a considerable reduction of time and memory requirements.",Medical Physics,"17 April, 2023",2304.08105,,"@misc{2304.08105,

Simultaneous Reduction of Number of Spots and Energy Layers in Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy for Rapid Spot Scanning Delivery,"Anqi Fu, Vicki T. Taasti, Masoud Zarepisheh","Objective: To improve the delivery efficiency of spot scanning proton therapy by simultaneously reducing the number of spots and energy layers using the reweighted $l_1$ regularization method. Approach: We formulated the proton treatment planning problem as a convex optimization problem with a cost function consisting of a dosimetric plan quality term plus a weighted $l_1$ regularization term. We iteratively solved this problem and adaptively updated the regularization weights to promote the sparsity of both the spots and energy layers. The proposed algorithm was tested on four head-and-neck patients, and its performance, in terms of reducing the number of spots and energy layers, was compared with existing standard $l_1$ and group $l_2$ regularization methods. We also compared the effectiveness of the three methods ($l_1$, group $l_2$, and reweighted $l_1$) at improving plan delivery efficiency without compromising dosimetric plan quality by constructing each of their Pareto surfaces charting the trade-off between plan delivery and plan quality. Main results: The reweighted $l_1$ regularization method reduced the number of spots and layers by an average of 40% and 35%, respectively, with an insignificant cost to dosimetric plan quality. From the Pareto surfaces, it is clear that reweighted $l_1$ provided a better trade-off between plan delivery efficiency and dosimetric plan quality than standard $l_1$ or group $l_2$ regularization, requiring the lowest cost to quality to achieve any given level of delivery efficiency. Significance: Reweighted $l_1$ regularization is a powerful method for simultaneously promoting the sparsity of spots and energy layers at a small cost to dosimetric plan quality. This sparsity reduces the time required for spot scanning and energy layer switching, thereby improving the delivery efficiency of proton plans.","Medical Physics, Optimization and Control","21 April, 2023",2304.11287,,"@misc{2304.11287,

OpenTPS -- Open-source treatment planning system for research in proton therapy,"S. Wuyckens, D. Dasnoy, G. Janssens, V. Hamaide, M. Huet, E. Loÿen, G. Rotsart de Hertaing, B. Macq, E. Sterpin, J. A. Lee, K. Souris, S. Deffet","Introduction. Treatment planning systems (TPS) are an essential component for simulating and optimizing a radiation therapy treatment before administering it to the patient. It ensures that the tumor is well covered and the dose to the healthy tissues is minimized. However, the TPS provided by commercial companies often come with a large panel of tools, each implemented in the form of a black-box making it difficult for researchers to use them for implementing and testing new ideas. To address this issue, we have developed an open-source TPS. Approach. We have developed an open-source software platform, OpenTPS (opentps.org), to generate treatment plans for external beam radiation therapy, and in particular for proton therapy. It is designed to be a flexible and user-friendly platform (coded with the freely usable Python language) that can be used by medical physicists, radiation oncologists, and other members of the radiation therapy community to create customized treatment plans for educational and research purposes. Result. OpenTPS includes a range of tools and features that can be used to analyze patient anatomy, simulate the delivery of the radiation beam, and optimize the treatment plan to achieve the desired dose distribution. It can be used to create treatment plans for a variety of cancer types and was designed to be extended to other treatment modalities. Significance. A new open-source treatment planning system has been built for research in proton therapy. Its flexibility allows an easy integration of new techniques and customization of treatment plans. It is freely available for use and is regularly updated and supported by a community of users and developers who contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of the software.",Medical Physics,"1 March, 2023",2303.00365,,"@misc{2303.00365,

Optimization of patient-specific range modulators for conformal FLASH proton therapy,"Sylvain Deffet, Kevin Souris, Edmond Sterpin","Purpose: A promising approach to enable FLASH conformal proton therapy is to passively degrade a single energy layer using a patient-specific range modulator. We propose an innovative method to directly optimize the geometrical characteristics of the range modulator and the treatment plan with respect to user defined constraints, similarly to state-of-the-art IMPT inverse planning.
  Methods: The kind of range modulators proposed in this study is a voxelized object which can be placed in the CT for dose computation, which simplifies the simulation pipeline. Both the geometrical characteristics of the range modulator and the weights of the PBS spots were directly optimized with respect to constraints on the dose using a first-order method. A modified Monte Carlo dose engine was used to provide an estimate of the gradient of the relaxed constraints with respect to the elevation values of the range modulator.
  Results: Assessed on a head and neck case, dose conformity logically appeared to be significantly degraded compared to IMPT. We then demonstrated that this degradation came mainly from the use of a large range shifter and therefore from physical limitations inherent in the passive degradation of beam energy. The geometry of the range modulator, on the other hand, was shown to be very close to being optimal. PBS dose rates were computed and discussed with respect to FLASH objectives.
  Conclusions: The voxelized range modulators optimized with the proposed method were proven to be optimal on a head and neck case characterized by two rather large volumes, with irregular contours and variable depths. The optimized geometry differed from conventional ridge filters as it was arbitrarily set by the optimizer. This kind of range modulators can be directly added in the CT for dose computation and is well suited for 3D printing.",Medical Physics,"15 March, 2023",2303.08649,,"@misc{2303.08649,

Variations of the relative biological effectiveness with fractionation in proton therapy : analysis of prostate cancer response,"Juan Pardo-Montero, Miguel Pombar, Antonio Gómez-Caamaño, Simona Giordanengo, Isabel González-Crespo","Purpose: To present a methodology to analyze the variation of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) with fractionation from clinical data of tumor control probability (TCP) and to apply it to study the response of prostate cancer to proton therapy.
  Methods: We have analyzed the dependence of the RBE on the dose per fraction by using the LQ model and the Poisson TCP formalism. Experimental TCPs for prostate cancer (low risk, LR, and intermediate risk, IR) treated with photon and proton therapy for conventional fractionation (2 GyE$\times$37 fractions), moderate hypofractionation (3 GyE$\times$20 fractions) and hypofractionation (7.25 GyE$\times$5 fractions) were obtained from the literature and analyzed.
  Results: The dependence of the RBE on the dose per fraction presents three theoretical regions, with RBE monotonically decreasing, increasing or constant with the dose per fraction, depending on the change of ($α$, $β$) values between photon and proton irradiation (the equilibrium point being at ($α_p$/$β_p$)=($α_X$/$β_X$)($α_X$/$α_p$)). An analysis of the clinical data shows RBE values that decline with increasing dose per fraction: for LR RBE=1.124, 1.119, and 1.102 for 1.82 Gy, 2.73 Gy and 6.59 Gy per fraction (proton doses), respectively; for IR RBE=1.119, and 1.102 for 1.82 Gy, and 6.59 Gy per fraction, respectively.
  Conclusions: Our analysis shows a monotonically decreasing RBE with increasing dose per fraction for prostate cancer, which is expected from the LQ formalism and the changes in ($α$, $β$) between photon and proton irradiation. However, due to the limited number of schedules and patients per schedule, the observed decrease of RBE with increasing dose is not significant for LR prostate cancer. For IR prostate cancer, the RBE obtained at 7.25 GyE seems to be significantly lower than that obtained at 2 GyE.",Medical Physics,"16 March, 2023",2303.09485,,"@misc{2303.09485,

A novel inverse algorithm to solve IPO-IMPT of proton FLASH therapy with sparse filters,"Nathan Harrison, Minglei Kang, Ruirui Liu, Serdar Charyyev, Niklas Wahl, Wei Liu, Jun Zhou, Kristin A. Higgins, Charles Simone, Jeffrey Bradley, William S. Dynan, Liyong Lin","Purpose:The recently proposed IPO-IMPT framework allows simultaneous optimization of dose, dose rate, and LET for FLASH treatment planning. Finding solutions to IPO-IMPT is difficult due to computational intensiveness. Nevertheless, an inverse solution that simultaneously specifies the geometry of a sparse filter and weights of a proton intensity map is desirable for both clinical and preclinical applications. Such solutions can reduce effective biological dose to organs at risk in cancer patients as well as reduce the number of animal irradiations needed to derive extra biological dose models in preclinical studies.
  Methods:Unlike our initial forward heuristic, this inverse IPO-IMPT solution includes simultaneous optimization of sparse range compensation, sparse range modulation, and spot intensity. The daunting computational tasks vital to this endeavor were resolved iteratively with a distributed computing framework to enable Simultaneous Intensity and Energy Modulation and Compensation (SIEMAC). SIEMAC was demonstrated on a human lung cancer patient and a minipig.
  Results:SIEMAC improves maps of spot intensities and patient-field-specific sparse range compensators and range modulators. For the lung cancer patient, at our max nozzle current of 300 nA, dose rate coverage above 100 Gy/s increased from 57% to 96% in the lung and from 93% to 100% in the heart, and LET coverage above 4 keV/um dropped from 68% to 9% in the lung and from 26% to <1% in the heart. For a simple minipig plan, the FWHM of the dose, dose rate, and LET distributions decreased by 30%, 1.6%, and 57%, respectively, again with similar target dose coverage, thus reducing uncertainty in these quantities for preclinical studies.

Sensitivity analysis of biological washout and depth selection for a machine learning based dose verification framework in proton therapy,"Shixiong Yu, Yuxiang Liu, Zongsheng Hu, Haozhao Zhang, Pengyu Qi, Hao Peng","Dose verification based on proton-induced positron emitters is a promising quality assurance tool and may leverage the strength of artificial intelligence. To move a step closer towards practical application, the sensitivity analysis of two factors needs to be performed: biological washout and depth selection. selection. A bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) model was developed. The training dataset was generated based upon a CT image-based phantom (abdomen region) and multiple beam energies/pathways, using Monte-Carlo simulation (1 mm spatial resolution, no biological washout). For the modeling of biological washout, a simplified analytical model was applied to change raw activity profiles over a period of 5 minutes, incorporating both physical decay and biological washout. For the study of depth selection (a challenge linked to multi field/angle irradiation), truncations were applied at different window lengths (100, 125, 150 mm) to raw activity profiles. Finally, the performance of a worst-case scenario was examined by combining both factors (depth selection: 125 mm, biological washout: 5 mins). The accuracy was quantitatively evaluated in terms of range uncertainty, mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative errors (MRE). Our proposed AI framework shows good immunity to the perturbation associated with two factors.

Brandon Gunn, Steven J. Frank, Xiaorong R. Zhu","We developed a novel method of creating intensity modulated proton arc therapy (IMPAT) plans that uses computing resources efficiently and may offer a dosimetric benefit for patients with ependymoma or similar tumor geometries. Our IMPAT planning method consists of a geometry-based energy selection step with major scanning spot contributions as inputs computed using ray-tracing and single-Gaussian approximation of lateral spot profiles. Based on the geometric relation of scanning spots and dose voxels, our energy selection module selects a minimum set of energy layers at each gantry angle such that each target voxel is covered by sufficient scanning spots as specified by the planner, with dose contributions above the specified threshold. Finally, IMPAT plans are generated by robustly optimizing scanning spots of the selected energy layers using a commercial proton treatment planning system. The IMPAT plan quality was assessed for four ependymoma patients. Reference three-field IMPT plans were created with similar planning objective functions and compared with the IMPAT plans. In all plans, the prescribed dose covered 95% of the clinical target volume (CTV) while maintaining similar maximum doses for the brainstem. While IMPAT and IMPT achieved comparable plan robustness, the IMPAT plans achieved better homogeneity and conformity than the IMPT plans. The IMPAT plans also exhibited higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) enhancement than did the corresponding reference IMPT plans for the CTV in all four patients and brainstem in three of them.

Although multiple groups have been endeavoring to develop online APT technology, there is a concern in the radiotherapy community about the necessity of online APT because of its unknown impact on treatment outcomes. Hence, we have performed a retrospective study to investigate the potential clinical effects of online APT for HN cancer patients in relative to the current offline APT via simulations. To mimic an online APT treatment course, we have recalculated and evaluated the actual dose of the current treatment plan on patient actual treatment anatomy captured by cone beam CT for each fraction. The cumulative dose of simulated online APT courses was compared to actual offline APT courses and the initially designed treatment plan dose. For patients 1 and 2, the simulated online ART course maintained a relatively higher CTV dose coverages than the offline ART course, particularly for CTV-Low, which led to an improvement of 2.66% and 4.52% in TCP of CTV-Low. For patients 3 and 4, with clinically comparable CTV dose coverages, the simulated online ART course achieved better OAR sparing than the offline ART course. The mean doses of right parotid and oral cavity were decreased from 29.52 Gy relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and 41.89 Gy RBE to 22.16 Gy RBE and 34.61 Gy RBE for patient 3, leading to a reduce of 1.67% and 3.40% in NTCP for the two organs.

This paper provides a comparison between the previously published values and analyzes the Monte Carlo calculated neutron dose from the present work using the neutron cross-section data. The purpose is to provide a range for the convergence of several neutron-absorbed dose data points (e.g. 3.94 mSv/Gy in a Bonner sphere measurement and 0.4 mSv/Gy in a SWENDI measurement) in previous works of other authors.",Medical Physics,"14 November, 2022",2210.12602,,"@misc{2210.12602,

Early in vivo Radiation Damage Quantification for Pediatric Craniospinal Irradiation Using Longitudinal MRI for Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy,"Chih-Wei Chang, Matt Goette, Nadja Kadom, Yinan Wang, Jacob Wynne, Tonghe Wang, Tian Liu, Natia Esiashvili, Jun Zhou, Bree R. Eaton, Xiaofeng Yang","Purpose: Proton vertebral body sparing craniospinal irradiation (VBS CSI) treats the thecal sac while avoiding the anterior vertebral bodies in effort to reduce myelosuppression and growth inhibition. However, robust treatment planning needs to compensate proton range uncertainty, contributing unwanted doses within the vertebral bodies. This work aims to develop an early in vivo radiation damage quantification method using longitudinal magnetic resonance (MR) scans to quantify dose effect during fractionated CSI. Materials and methods: Ten pediatric patients were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial of proton VBS CSI receiving 23.4-36 Gy. Monte Carlo robust planning was used with spinal clinical target volumes defined as the thecal sac and neural foramina. T1/T2-weighted MR scans were acquired before, during, and after treatments to detect transition from hematopoietic to less metabolically active fatty marrow. MR signal intensity histograms at each time point were analyzed and fitted by multi-Gaussian models to quantify radiation damages. Results: Fatty marrow filtration was observed on MR images as early as the fifth fraction of treatment. Maximum radiation-induced marrow damage occurred 40-50 days from the treatment start, followed by marrow regeneration. The mean damage ratios were 0.23, 0.41, 0.59, and 0.54 corresponding to 10, 20, 40, and 60 days from the treatment start. Conclusions: We demonstrated a non-invasive method to identify early vertebral marrow damage based on radiation-induced fatty marrow replacement. The proposed method can be potentially used to quantify the quality of CSI vertebral sparing to preserve metabolically active hematopoietic bone marrow.",Medical Physics,"28 October, 2022",2210.15557,,"@misc{2210.15557,

A DL-based framework was developed to discover underlying voxel-wise correlation between MR images and mass density and RSP.

PET distributions obtained during various treatment sessions can be compared in order to identify regions that have anatomical changes. The purpose of this work is to test and compare different analysis methods in the context of inter-fractional PET image comparison for proton treatment verification.
  Methods: For our study we used the FLUKA Monte Carlo code and artificially generated CT scans to simulate in-beam PET distributions at different stages during proton therapy treatment. We compared the Beam-Eye-View method, the Most-Likely-Shift method, the Voxel-Based-Morphology method and the gamma evaluation method to compare PET images at the start of treatment, and after a few weeks of treatment. The results were compared to the CT scan.
  Results and conclusions: Three-dimensional methods like VBM and gamma are preferred above two-dimensional methods like MLS and BEV if much statistics is available, since the these methods allow to identify the regions with anomalous activity. The VBM approach has as disadvantage that a larger number of MC simulations is needed. The gamma analysis has the disadvantage that no clinical indication exist on tolerance criteria.

Assessment of the proton boron fusion reaction for practical radiation therapy applications using MCNP6,"David P. Adam, Bryan P. Bednarz","The proton boron fusion reaction, 11B(p, 3α), is investigated using MCNP6 to assess the viability for potential use in radiation therapy. The 11B(p, 3α) is theoretically desirable because it could combine the localized dose delivery protons exhibit (Bragg peak) with the creation of three high LET α particles that locally deposit energy in tumor regions. Simple simulations of a proton pencil beam incident upon a water phantom and a water phantom with an axial region also containing boron were modeled using MCNP6 in order to determine the extent of the impact boron had upon the calculated energy deposition. The MCNP simulations performed demonstrated that the proton boron fusion reaction rate at clinically relevant boron concentrations was too small in order to have any measurable impact on the absorbed dose. It was determined that there are no good evaluations of the 11B(p, 3α) reaction for use in MCNPX/6 and further work should be conducted in cross section evaluations in order to definitively evaluate the feasibility of the proton boron fusion reaction for use in radiation therapy applications.",Medical Physics,"29 September, 2022",2209.14546,,"@misc{2209.14546,

Sharp dose profiles for high precision proton therapy using focused proton beams,"Fardous Reaz, Kyrre Ness Sjobak, Eirik Malinen, Nina Frederike Jeppesen Edin, Erik Adli","Proton beam therapy has been developed to irradiate the tumor with higher precision and dose conformity compared to conventional X-ray irradiation. The dose conformity of this treatment modality may be further improved if narrower proton beams are used. Still, this is limited by multiple Coulomb scattering of protons through tissue. The primary aim of this work was to develop techniques to produce narrow proton beams and investigate the resulting dose profiles. We introduced and assessed three different proton beam shaping techniques: 1) metal collimators (100/150~MeV), 2) focusing of conventional- (100/150~MeV), and 3) focusing of high-energy (350~MeV, shoot-through) proton beams. Focusing was governed by the initial value of the Twiss parameter $α$~($α_0$), and can be implemented with magnetic particle accelerator optics. The dose distributions in water were calculated by Monte Carlo simulations using Geant4, and evaluated by target to surface dose ratio (TSDR) in addition to the transverse beam size~($σ_T$) at the target. The target was defined as the location of the Bragg peak or the focal point. The different techniques showed greatly differing dose profiles, where focusing gave pronouncedly higher relative target dose and efficient use of primary protons. Metal collimators with radii < 2~mm gave low TSDRs (<~0.7) and large $σ_T$(>~3.6~mm). In contrast, a focused beam of conventional (150~MeV) energy produced a very high TSDR (>~80) with similar $σ_T$ as a collimated beam. High-energy focused beams were able to produce TSDRs > 100 and $σ_T$ around 1.5~mm. From this study, it appears very attractive to implement magnetically focused proton beams in radiotherapy of small lesions or tumors in close vicinity to healthy organs at risk. This can also lead to a paradigm change in spatially fractionated radiotherapy.","Medical Physics, Accelerator Physics","2 September, 2022",2209.0094,,"@misc{2209.00940,

Characterization of 250 MeV protons from Varian ProBeam pencil beam scanning system for FLASH radiation therapy,"Serdar Charyyev, Chih-Wei Chang, Mingyao Zhu, Liyong Lin, Katja Langen, Anees Dhabaan","Recently, shoot-through proton FLASH has been proposed where the highest energy is extracted from the cyclotron to maximize the dose rate (DR). Even though our proton pencil beam scanning system can deliver 250 MeV (the highest energy), it is not typical to use 250 MeV protons for routine clinical treatments and as such 250 MeV may not have been characterized in the commissioning. In this study, we aim to characterize 250 MeV protons from Varian ProBeam system for FLASH RT as well as assess the ability of clinical monitoring ionization chamber (MIC) for FLASH-readiness. We measured data needed for beam commissioning: integral depth dose (IDD) curve, spot sigma, and absolute dose calibration. To evaluate MIC, we measured output as a function of beam current. To characterize a 250 MeV FLASH beam, we measured: (1) central axis DR as a function of current and spot spacing and arrangement, (2) for a fixed spot spacing, the maximum field size that still achieves FLASH DR (i.e., > 40 Gy/s), (3) DR reproducibility. All FLASH DR measurements were performed using ion chamber for the absolute dose and irradiation times were obtained from log files. We verified dose measurements using EBT-XD films and irradiation times using a fast, pixelated spectral detector. R90 and R80 from IDD were 37.58 and 37.69 cm, and spot sigma at isocenter were σx=3.336 and σy=3.332 mm, respectively. The absolute dose output was measured as 0.377 GyE*mm2/MU for the commissioning conditions. Output was stable for beam currents up to 15 nA, and it gradually increased to 12-fold for 115 nA. DR depended on beam current, spot spacing and arrangement and could be reproduced within 4.2% variations. Even though FLASH was achieved and the largest field size that delivers FLASH DR was determined as 35x35 mm2, current MIC has DR dependence and users should measure DR each time for their FLASH applications.",Medical Physics,"25 January, 2023",2208.05037,,"@misc{2208.05037,

A deterministic adjoint-based semi-analytical algorithm for fast response change computations in proton therapy,"Tiberiu Burlacu, Danny Lathouwers, Zoltán Perkó","In this paper we propose a solution to the need for a fast particle transport algorithm in Online Adaptive Proton Therapy capable of cheaply, but accurately computing the changes in patient dose metrics as a result of changes in the system parameters. We obtain the proton phase-space density through the product of the numerical solution to the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation and the analytical solution to the Fermi-Eyges equation. Moreover, a corresponding adjoint system was derived and solved for the adjoint flux. The proton phase-space density together with the adjoint flux and the metric (chosen as the energy deposited by the beam in a variable region of interest) allowed assessing the accuracy of our algorithm to different perturbation ranges in the system parameters and regions of interest. The algorithm achieved negligible errors ($1.1 \times 10^{-6}$ $\%$ to $3.6 \times 10^{-3}$ $\%$) for small perturbation ranges ($-40 \text{ HU to } 40 \text{ HU}$) and small to moderate errors ($3 \text{ $\%$ to } 17 \text{ $\%$}$) -- in line with the well-known limitation of adjoint approaches -- for large perturbation ranges ($-400 \text{ HU to } 400 \text{ HU}$) in the case of most clinical interest where the region of interest surrounds the Bragg peak.

An ion-independent phenomenological relative biological effectiveness (RBE) model for proton therapy,"Liheng Tian, Christian Hahn, Armin Luehr","Background: A relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 is used for proton therapy though clinical evidence of varying RBE was raised. Clinical studies on RBE variability have been conducted for decades for carbon radiation, which could advance the understanding of the clinical proton RBE given an ion-independent RBE model. In this work, such a model, linear and simple, using the beam quantity Q = Z^2/E (Z = ion charge, E = kinetic energy per nucleon) was tested and compared to the commonly used, proton-specific and linear energy transfer (LET) based Wedenberg RBE model. Material and methods: The Wedenberg and Q models, both predicting RBEmax and RBEmin (i.e., RBE at vanishing and very high dose, respectively), are compared in terms of ion-dependence and prediction power. An experimental in-vitro data ensemble covering 115 publications for various ions was used as dataset. Results: The model parameter of the Q model was observed to be similar for different ions (in contrast to LET). The Q model was trained without any prior knowledge of proton data. For proton RBE, the differences between experimental data and corresponding predictions of the Wedenberg or the Q model were highly comparable. Conclusions: A simple linear RBE model using Q instead of LET was proposed and tested to be able to predict proton RBE using model parameter trained based on only RBE data of other particles in a clinical proton energy range for a large in-vitro dataset. Adding (pre)clinical knowledge from carbon ion therapy may, therefore, reduce the dominating biological uncertainty in proton RBE modelling.

Variable length genetic algorithm with continuous parameters optimization of beam layout in proton therapy,"François Smekens, Nicolas Freud, Bruno Sixou, Guillaume Beslon, Jean M Létang","Proton therapy is a modality in fast development. Characterized by a maximum dose deposition at the end of the proton trajectory followed by a sharp fall-off, proton beams can deliver a highly conformal dose to the tumor while sparing organs at risk and surrounding healthy tissues. New treatment planning systems based on spot scanning techniques can now propose multi-field optimization. However, in most cases, this optimization only processes the field fluences whereas the choice of ballistics (field geometry) is left to the oncologist and medical physicist.
  In this work, we investigate a new optimization framework based on a genetic approach. This tool is intended to explore new irradiation schemes and to evaluate the potential of actual or future irradiation systems. We propose to optimize simultaneously the target points and beam incidence angles in a continuous manner and with a variable number of beams. No \textit{a priori} technological constraints are taken into account, \textit{i.e.}~the beam energy values, incidence directions and target points are free parameters.
  The proposed algorithm is based on a modified version of classical genetic operators: mutation, crossover and selection. We use the real coding associated with random perturbations of the parameters to obtain a continuous variation of the potential solutions. We also introduce a perturbation in the exchange points of the crossover to allow variations of the number of beams. These variations are controlled by introducing a beam fluence lower limit.
  In this paper, we present a complete description of the algorithm and of its behaviour in an elementary test case. The proposed method is finally assessed in a clinically-realistic test case.","Medical Physics, Neural and Evolutionary Computing","17 May, 2022",2205.08398,,"@misc{2205.08398,

Towards the optimization of ballistics in proton therapy using genetic algorithms: implementation issues,"François Smekens, Nicolas Freud, Bruno Sixou, Guillaume Beslon, Jean M Létang","The dose delivered to the planning target volume by proton beams is highly conformal, sparing organs at risk and normal tissues. New treatment planning systems adapted to spot scanning techniques have been recently proposed to simultaneously optimize several fields and thus improve dose delivery. In this paper, we investigate a new optimization framework based on a genetic algorithm approach. This tool is intended to make it possible to explore new schemes of treatment delivery, possibly with future enhanced technologies. The optimization framework is designed to be versatile and to account for many degrees of freedom, without any {\it a priori} technological constraint. To test the behavior of our algorithm, we propose in this paper, as an example, to optimize beam fluences, target points and irradiation directions at the same time.
  The proposed optimization routine takes typically into account several thousands of spots of fixed size. The evolution is carried out by the three standard genetic operators: mutation, crossover and selection. The figure-of-merit (or fitness) is based on an objective function relative to the dose prescription to the tumor and to the limits set for organs at risk and normal tissues. Fluence optimization is carried out via a specific scheme based on a plain gradient with analytical solution. Several specific genetic algorithm issues are addressed: (i) the mutation rate is tuned to balance the search and selection forces, (ii) the initial population is selected using a bootstrap technique and (iii) to scale down the computation time, dose calculations are carried out with a fast analytical ray tracing method and are multi-threaded.
  In this paper implementation issues of the optimization framework are thoroughly described. The behavior of the proposed genetic algorithm is illustrated in both elementary and clinically-realistic test cases.","Medical Physics, Neural and Evolutionary Computing","17 May, 2022",2205.08283,,"@misc{2205.08283,

Clinical use and future requirements of relative biological effectiveness: survey among all european proton therapy centres,"Lena Heuchel, Christian Hahn, Jörg Pawelke, Brita Singers Sørensen, Manjit Dosanjh, Armin Lühr","Background and purpose: The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) varies along the treatment field. However, in clinical practice, a constant RBE of 1.1 is assumed, which can result in undesirable side effects. This study provides an accurate overview of current clinical practice for considering proton RBE in Europe. Materials and Methods: A survey was devised and sent to all proton therapy centres in Europe that treat patients. The online questionnaire consisted of 39 questions addressing various aspects of RBE consideration in clinical practice, including treatment planning, patient follow-up and future demands. Results: All 25 proton therapy centres responded. All centres prescribed a constant RBE of 1.1, but also applied measures (except for one eye treatment centre) to counteract variable RBE effects such as avoiding beams stopping inside or in front of an organ at risk and putting restrictions on the minimum number and opening angle of incident beams for certain treatment sites. For the future, most centres (16) asked for more retrospective or prospective outcome studies investigating the potential effect of the effect of a variable RBE. To perform such studies, 18 centres asked for LET and RBE calculation and visualisation tools developed by treatment planning system vendors. Conclusion: All European proton centres are aware of RBE variability but comply with current guidelines of prescribing a constant RBE. However, they actively mitigate uncertainty and risk of side effects resulting from increased RBE by applying measures and restrictions during treatment planning. To change RBE-related clinical guidelines in the future more clinical data on RBE are explicitly demanded.",Medical Physics,"30 May, 2022",2205.14944,10.1016/j.radonc.2022.05.015,"@misc{2205.14944,

Characterization of pixelated silicon detectors for daily quality assurance measurements in proton therapy,"Isabelle Schilling, Claus Maximillian Bäcker, Christian Bäumer, Carina Behrends, Kevin Kröninger, Beate Timmermann, Jens Weingarten","The advanced imaging and delivery techniques in proton therapy allow conformal high-dose irradiation of the target volume with high accuracy using pencil beam scanning or beam shaping apertures. These irradiation methods increasingly include small radiation fields with large dose gradients, which require detector systems with high spatial resolution for quality assurance. In addition the measurement of all success parameters for daily quality assurance with only one proton field and one simple detector system would save a lot of time in clinical usage. Based on their good spatial resolution and high rate compatibility, pixelated silicon detectors could meet the new requirements. To assess their applicability in proton therapy, ATLAS pixelated silicon detectors are used to measure the lateral beam profile with high spatial resolution. Furthermore, a dose dependent detector calibration is presented to allow the measurement of the requested output constancy.

Towards machine learning aided real-time range imaging in proton therapy,"Jorge Lerendegui-Marco, Javier Balibrea-Correa, Víctor Babiano-Súarez, Ion Ladarescu, César Domingo-Pardo","In this work, we report on the advantageous aspects of the i-TED Compton imager for proton-range monitoring, based on the results of the first Monte Carlo study of its applicability to this field. i-TED is an array of Compton cameras, that have been designed for neutron-capture nuclear physics experiments, which are characterized by $γ$-ray energies spanning up to 5-6 MeV, rather low $γ$-ray emission yields and intense neutron induced $γ$-ray backgrounds. Our developments to cope with these three aspects are concomitant with those required in the field of hadron therapy, especially in terms of high efficiency for real-time monitoring, low sensitivity to neutron backgrounds and reliable performance at the high $γ$-ray energies. We find that signal-to-background ratios can be appreciably improved with i-TED thanks to its light-weight design and the low neutron-capture cross sections of its LaCl$_{3}$ crystals, when compared to other similar systems based on LYSO, CdZnTe or LaBr$_{3}$. Its high time-resolution (CRT$\sim$500 ps) represents an additional advantage for background suppression when operated in pulsed HT mode. Each i-TED module features two detection planes of very large LaCl$_{3}$ monolithic crystals, thereby achieving a high efficiency in coincidence of 0.2% for a point-like 1MeV $γ$-ray source at 5 cm distance. This leads to sufficient statistics for reliable image reconstruction with an array of four i-TED detectors assuming clinical intensities of 10$^{8}$ protons per treatment point. The use of a two-plane design instead of three-planes has been preferred owing to the higher attainable efficiency for double time-coincidences than for threefold events. The loss of full-energy events for high energy $γ$-rays is compensated by means of Machine-Learning algorithms, which allow one to enhance the signal-to-total ratio up to a factor of 2.","Medical Physics, Nuclear Experiment, Instrumentation and Detectors","31 January, 2022",2201.13269,,"@misc{2201.13269,

Fetus dose calculation during proton therapy of pregnant phantoms using MCNPX and MCNP6.2 codes,"Marijke De Saint-Hubert, Katarzyna Tyminska, Liliana Stolarczyk, Hrvoje Brkic","Radiotherapy of pregnant cancer patients is not common, but when applied accurate assessment of the fetus dose is required, especially since the treatment planning systems are not able and do not allow accurate assessment of out-of-field doses. Proton therapy significantly reduces out-of-field doses, such as dose to the fetus, when compared to the photon radiotherapy techniques and as such could be promising for pregnant cancer patients. Within this study Monte Carlo calculations are performed on the three different computational phantoms representing pregnant women, all in second trimester of pregnancy. Simplified proton beam to the pregnant women brain was modelled, and the total dose equivalent (normalized per target dose) to the fetus was calculated. Between MCNPX and MCNP6.2 code versions we observed up to 6% difference. In this work 3 groups participated and the variation between the groups was 8% and 12% for MCNPX and MCNP6.2, respectively.

Major contribution to the total dose came from the neutrons, with only 20% of the dose coming from photons, while other particles have negligible contributions.

Here we show that reducing the incident proton beam energy spread may significantly improve RSP determination in pCT. We demonstrate that the reduction of beam energy spread from the typical 1.0% (at 70MeV) down to 0.2%, can be achieved at the proton currents needed for imaging at the Paul Scherrer Institut 230MeV cyclotron. Through a simulated pCT imaging system, we find that this effect results in RSP resolutions as low as 0.2% for materials such as cortical bone, up to 1% for lung tissue.

Attention U-net approach in predicting Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy dose distribution in brain glioma tumor,"Mobina Naeemi, Mohamad Reza Esmaeili, Iraj Abedi","Today, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is one of the methods used to treat brain tumors. In conventional treatment planning methods, after identifying planning target volume (PTV), and organs at risk (OARs), and determining the limitations for them to receive radiation, the dose distribution is performed based on optimization algorithms, which is usually a time-consuming method. In this article, artificial intelligence is used to acquire the knowledge used in the treatment planning of past patients and to plan for new patients to speed up the process of treatment planning and determination of the appropriate dose distribution. In this paper, using deep learning algorithms, two different approaches are studied to predict dose distribution and compared with actual dose distributions. In the first method, only the images containing PTV and the distribution of the corresponding doses are used to train the convolutional neural network, but in the second one, in addition to PTV, the contours of four OARs are also used to introduce the network. The results show that the performance of both methods on test patients have high accuracy and in comparison with each other almost have the same results and high speed to design the dose distribution. Because the Only-PTV method does not have the process of OARs identifying, applying it in designing the dose distribution will be much faster than using the PTV-OARs method in the whole of treatment planning.","Quantitative Methods, Signal Processing, Medical Physics","10 May, 2023",2305.07033,,"@misc{2305.07033,

Radiation -induced Acoustic Signal Denoising using a Supervised Deep Learning Framework for Imaging and Therapy Monitoring,"Zhuoran Jiang, Siqi Wang, Yifei Xu, Leshan Sun, Gilberto Gonzalez, Yong Chen, Q.

However, it requires measuring hundreds or even thousands of averages to achieve satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This repetitive measurement increases ionizing radiation dose and degrades the temporal resolution of RA imaging, limiting its clinical utility. In this study, we developed a general deep inception convolutional neural network (GDI-CNN) to denoise RA signals to substantially reduce the number of averages. The multi-dilation convolutions in the network allow for encoding and decoding signal features with varying temporal characteristics, making the network generalizable to signals from different radiation sources. The proposed method was evaluated using experimental data of X-ray-induced acoustic, protoacoustic, and electroacoustic signals, qualitatively and quantitatively. Results demonstrated the effectiveness and generalizability of GDI-CNN: for all the enrolled RA modalities, GDI-CNN achieved comparable SNRs to the fully-averaged signals using less than 2% of the averages, significantly reducing imaging dose and improving temporal resolution.

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Beam Angle Optimization of Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy,"Peng Bao, Gong Wang, Ruijie Yang, Bin Dong","Objective: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) beam angle optimization (BAO) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard. In this study, we aim to develop a personalized BAO algorithm for IMRT that improves the quality of the final treatment. Methods: To improve the quality of IMRT treatment planning, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for IMRT BAO. We consider the task as a sequential decision-making problem and formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. To facilitate the training process, a 3D-Unet is designed to predict the dose distribution for the different number of beam angles, ranging from 1 to 9, to simulate the IMRT environment. By leveraging the simulation model, double deep-Q network (DDQN) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) are used to train agents to select the personalized beam angle sequentially within a few seconds. Results: The treatment plans with beam angles selected by DRL outperform those with clinically used evenly distributed beam angles. For DDQN, the overall average improvement of the CIs is 0.027, 0.032, and 0.03 for 5, 7, and 9 beam angles respectively.

Accurate and fast deep learning dose prediction for a preclinical microbeam radiation therapy study using low-statistics Monte Carlo simulations,"Florian Mentzel, Jason Paino, Micah Barnes, Matthew Cameron, Stéphanie Corde, Elette Engels, Kevin Kröninger, Michael Lerch, Olaf Nackenhorst, Anatoly Rosenfeld, Moeva Tehei, Ah Chung Tsoi, Sarah Vogel, Jens Weingarten, Markus Hagenbuchner, Susanna Guatelli","Microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) utilizes coplanar synchrotron radiation beamlets and is a proposed treatment approach for several tumour diagnoses that currently have poor clinical treatment outcomes, such as gliosarcomas. Prescription dose estimations for treating preclinical gliosarcoma models in MRT studies at the Imaging and Medical Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron currently rely on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The steep dose gradients associated with the 50$\,μ$m wide coplanar beamlets present a significant challenge for precise MC simulation of the MRT irradiation treatment field in a short time frame. Much research has been conducted on fast dose estimation methods for clinically available treatments. However, such methods, including GPU Monte Carlo implementations and machine learning (ML) models, are unavailable for novel and emerging cancer radiation treatment options like MRT. In this work, the successful application of a fast and accurate machine learning dose prediction model in a retrospective preclinical MRT rodent study is presented for the first time. The ML model predicts the peak doses in the path of the microbeams and the valley doses between them, delivered to the gliosarcoma in rodent patients. The predictions of the ML model show excellent agreement with low-noise MC simulations, especially within the investigated tumour volume. This agreement is despite the ML model being deliberately trained with MC-calculated samples exhibiting significantly higher statistical uncertainties. The successful use of high-noise training set data samples, which are much faster to generate, encourages and accelerates the transfer of the ML model to different treatment modalities for other future applications in novel radiation cancer therapies.",Medical Physics,"6 April, 2023",2212.05659,10.3390/cancers15072137,"@misc{2212.05659,

A step towards treatment planning for microbeam radiation therapy : fast peak and valley dose predictions with 3D U-Nets,"Florian Mentzel, Micah Barnes, Kevin Kröninger, Michael Lerch, Olaf Nackenhorst, Jason Paino, Anatoly Rosenfeld, Ayu Saraswati, Ah Chung Tsoi, Jens Weingarten, Markus Hagenbuchner, Susanna Guatelli","Fast and accurate dose predictions are one of the bottlenecks in treatment planning for microbeam radiation therapy (MRT). In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML) model based on a 3D U-Net. Our approach predicts separately the large doses of the narrow high intensity synchrotron microbeams and the lower valley doses between them. For this purpose, a concept of macro peak doses and macro valley doses is introduced, describing the respective doses not on a microscopic level but as macroscopic quantities in larger voxels. The ML model is trained to mimic full Monte Carlo (MC) data. Complex physical effects such as polarization are therefore automatically taking into account by the model.
  The macro dose distribution approach described in this study allows for superimposing single microbeam predictions to a beam array field making it an interesting candidate for treatment planning.

Court","Purpose: This study aimed to use deep learning-based dose prediction to assess head and neck (HN) plan quality and identify suboptimal plans.
  Methods: A total of 245 VMAT HN plans were created using RapidPlan knowledge-based planning (KBP). A subset of 112 high-quality plans was selected under the supervision of an HN radiation oncologist. We trained a 3D Dense Dilated U-Net architecture to predict 3-dimensional dose distributions using 3-fold cross-validation on 90 plans. Model inputs included CT images, target prescriptions, and contours for targets and organs at risk (OARs). The model's performance was assessed on the remaining 22 test plans. We then tested the application of the dose prediction model for automated review of plan quality. Dose distributions were predicted on 14 clinical plans. The predicted versus clinical OAR dose metrics were compared to flag OARs with suboptimal normal tissue sparing using a 2 Gy dose difference or 3% dose-volume threshold. OAR flags were compared to manual flags by 3 HN radiation oncologists.
  Results: The predicted dose distributions were of comparable quality to the KBP plans. The differences between the predicted and KBP-planned D1%, D95%, and D99% across the targets were within -2.53%(SD=1.34%), -0.42%(SD=1.27%), and -0.12%(SD=1.97%), respectively, and the OAR mean and maximum doses were within -0.33Gy(SD=1.40Gy) and -0.96Gy(SD=2.08Gy). For the plan quality assessment study, radiation oncologists flagged 47 OARs for possible plan improvement. There was high interphysician variability; 83% of physician-flagged OARs were flagged by only one of 3 physicians. The comparative dose prediction model flagged 63 OARs, including 30 of 47 physician-flagged OARs.
  Conclusion: Deep learning can predict high-quality dose distributions, which can be used as comparative dose distributions for automated, individualized assessment of HN plan quality.",Medical Physics,"25 April, 2023",2209.14277,10.1016/j.prro.2022.12.003,"@misc{2209.14277,

By weighting and combining the model pairs for all organs-at-risk, we are able to dynamically create adjustable dose distributions that can be used, in real-time, to move doses between organs-at-risk, thereby customizing the dose distribution to the needs of a particular patient.

High-dimensional Automated Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning via Bayesian Optimization,"Qingying Wang, Ruoxi Wang, Jiacheng Liu, Fan Jiang, Haizhen Yue, Yi Du, Hao Wu","Radiation therapy treatment planning can be viewed as an iterative hyperparameter tuning process to balance conflicting clinical goals. In this work, we investigated the performance of modern Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods on automated treatment planning problems in high-dimensional settings. 20 locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were retrospectively selected as test cases. We implemented an automated treatment planning framework that adjusts dose objectives and weights simultaneously, and tested the performance of two BO methods on the treatment planning task: one standard BO method (GPEI) and one BO method dedicated to high-dimensional problems (SAAS-BO). A random tuning method was also included as the baseline. We compared and analyzed the three automated methods' plan quality and planning efficiency and the different search patterns of the two BO methods. For the target structures, the SAAS-BO plans achieved comparable hot spot control ($p=0.43$) and homogeneity ($p=0.96$) with the clinical plans, significantly better than the GPEI and random plans ($p<0.05$). Both SAAS-BO and GPEI plans significantly outperformed the clinical plans in conformity and dose spillage ($p<0.05$). Compared with clinical plans, the treatment plans generated by the three automated methods all made reductions in evaluated dosimetric indices for the femoral head and the bladder. The analysis of the underlying predictive models has shown that both BO procedures have identified similar important planning parameters.

Tantawi, Jeroen van Tilborg","Conventional cancer therapies include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and, more recently, immunotherapy. These modalities are often combined to improve the therapeutic index. The general concept of radiation therapy is to increase the therapeutic index by creating a physical dose differential between tumors and normal tissues through precision dose targeting, image guidance, and high radiation beams that deliver radiation dose with high conformality, e.g., protons and ions. However, treatment and cure are still limited by normal tissue radiation toxicity, with many patients experiencing acute and long-term side effects. Recently, however, a fundamentally different paradigm for increasing the therapeutic index of radiation therapy has emerged, supported by preclinical research, and based on the FLASH radiation effect. FLASH radiation therapy (FLASH-RT) is an ultra-high dose-rate delivery of a therapeutic radiation dose within a fraction of a second. Experimental studies have shown that normal tissues seem to be universally spared at these high dose rates, whereas tumors are not. The dose delivery conditions are not yet fully characterized. Still, it is currently estimated that large doses of 10 Gy or more delivered in 200 ms or less produce normal tissue sparing effects yet effectively kill tumor cells. There is a great opportunity, but also many technical challenges, for the accelerator community to create the required dose rates with novel and compact accelerators to ensure the safe delivery of FLASH radiation beams.","Medical Physics, Accelerator Physics","21 March, 2022",2203.11047,,"@misc{2203.11047,

Segmentation by Test-Time Optimization (TTO) for CBCT-based Adaptive Radiation Therapy,"Xiao Liang, Jaehee Chun, Howard Morgan, Ti Bai, Dan Nguyen, Justin C. Park, Steve Jiang","Online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) requires accurate and efficient auto-segmentation of target volumes and organs-at-risk (OARs) in mostly cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. Propagating expert-drawn contours from the pre-treatment planning CT (pCT) through traditional or deep learning (DL) based deformable image registration (DIR) can achieve improved results in many situations. Typical DL-based DIR models are population based, that is, trained with a dataset for a population of patients, so they may be affected by the generalizability problem. In this paper, we propose a method called test-time optimization (TTO) to refine a pre-trained DL-based DIR population model, first for each individual test patient, and then progressively for each fraction of online ART treatment. Our proposed method is less susceptible to the generalizability problem, and thus can improve overall performance of different DL-based DIR models by improving model accuracy, especially for outliers. Our experiments used data from 239 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma to test the proposed method. Firstly, we trained a population model with 200 patients, and then applied TTO to the remaining 39 test patients by refining the trained population model to obtain 39 individualized models. We compared each of the individualized models with the population model in terms of segmentation accuracy. The number of patients with at least 0.05 DSC improvement or 2 mm HD95 improvement by TTO averaged over the 17 selected structures for the state-of-the-art architecture Voxelmorph is 10 out of 39 test patients. The average time for deriving the individualized model using TTO from the pre-trained population model is approximately four minutes. When adapting the individualized model to a later fraction of the same patient, the average time is reduced to about one minute and the accuracy is slightly improved.","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Medical Physics","8 February, 2022",2202.03978,10.1002/mp.15960,"@misc{2202.03978,

Finite-element modeling of the alpha particle dose of realistic sources used in Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy,"Guy Heger, Lior Arazi","Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy (DaRT) is a new method for treating solid tumors using alpha particles. Unlike conventional radiotherapy, where the physical models for dose calculations are known and routinely used, for DaRT a new framework, called the Diffusion-Leakage (DL) model, had to be developed. In this work we provide a detailed description of a finite-element numerical scheme for solving the time-dependent DL model equations for cylindrical DaRT sources (``seeds'') of finite diameter and length in two dimensions. Using a fully-implicit scheme and adaptive time step, this approach allows to accurately follow temporal transients ranging from seconds to days. In addition to the full two-dimensional calculation, we further provide a closed-form approximation and a simple one-dimensional scheme to solve the equations for infinitely-long cylindrical sources. These simpler solutions can be used both to validate the two-dimensional code and to enable efficient parameter scans to study the properties of DaRT seed lattices.

Meta-optimization for Fully Automated Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,"Charles Huang, Yusuke Nomura, Yong Yang, Lei Xing","Objective: Radiation therapy treatment planning is a time-consuming process involving iterative adjustments of hyperparameters. To automate the treatment planning process, we propose a meta-optimization framework, called MetaPlanner (MP). Methods: Our MP algorithm automates planning by performing optimization of treatment planning hyperparameters. The algorithm uses a derivative-free method (i.e. parallel Nelder-Mead simplex search) to search for weight configurations that minimize a meta-scoring function. Meta-scoring is performed by constructing a tier list of the relevant considerations (e.g. dose homogeneity, conformity, spillage, and OAR sparing) to mimic the clinical decision-making process. Additionally, we have made our source code publicly available via github. Results: The proposed MP method is evaluated on two datasets (21 prostate cases and 6 head and neck cases) collected as part of clinical workflow. MP is applied to both IMRT and VMAT planning and compared to a baseline of manual VMAT plans. MP in both IMRT and VMAT scenarios has comparable or better performance than manual VMAT planning for all evaluated metrics. Conclusion: Our proposed MP provides a general framework for fully automated treatment planning that produces high quality treatment plans.

New dosimetry planning strategy based on continuous dose gradient used to reduce dose estimation errors due to respiratory motion in breast radiation therapy,"Mazen Moussallem, Pauline Harb, Hanane Rima, Zeina Al Kattar, Saad Ayoubi","A new strategy for radiation therapy dosimetry planning (RTDP) used to reduce dose estimation errors due to respiratory motion in breast treatment was illustrated and evaluated in this study. On CT data set acquired for breast treatment, six different RTDP tangential techniques were performed: (i) three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) with physical wedge, (ii) 3DCRT with virtual wedge, (iii) motion management technique (MMT) with physical wedge, (iv) MMT with virtual wedge, (v) 3DCRT with field-in-field, and (vi) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with direct aperture optimization. These anti-motion techniques were considered to generate continuous dose degradation to avoid drastic changes in the delivered doses that involve the edge regions of the beams. A comparison was made between the delivered and simulated doses, with and without the presence of motions simulations. This study demonstrates that techniques without motion management can be affected by motions that can lead to a difference equal to 19 % between the delivered and the planned doses in a point located near to the beams collimators edges, and to a difference up to 3 % on multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) edges (gamma pass rates were 87.9 % for 3%/3mm). These differences were reduced to 11 % and to less than 3 % (gamma pass rates were 100 % for 3%/3mm) when MMT were used. As a conclusion, in tangential techniques motion can affect dose estimations on the MLCs and beams collimators edges. The proposed MMT reduce this effect to estimate the delivered dose accurately.",Medical Physics,"19 October, 2021",2110.10089,,"@misc{2110.10089,

Probabilistic Pareto plan generation for semiautomated multicriteria radiation therapy treatment planning,"Tianfang Zhang, Rasmus Bokrantz, Jimmy Olsson","Objective: We propose a semiautomatic pipeline for radiation therapy treatment planning, combining ideas from machine learning-automated planning and multicriteria optimization (MCO).
  Approach: Using knowledge extracted from historically delivered plans, prediction models for spatial dose and dose statistics are trained and furthermore systematically modified to simulate changes in tradeoff priorities, creating a set of differently biased predictions. Based on the predictions, an MCO problem is subsequently constructed using previously developed dose mimicking functions, designed in such a way that its Pareto surface spans the range of clinically acceptable yet realistically achievable plans as exactly as possible. The result is an algorithm outputting a set of Pareto optimal plans, either fluence-based or machine parameter-based, which the user can navigate between in real time to make adjustments before a final deliverable plan is created.
  Main results: Numerical experiments performed on a dataset of prostate cancer patients show that one may often navigate to a better plan than one produced by a single-plan-output algorithm.

Robust automated radiation therapy treatment planning using scenario-specific dose prediction and robust dose mimicking,"Oskar Eriksson, Tianfang Zhang","Purpose: We present a framework for robust automated treatment planning using machine learning, comprising scenario-specific dose prediction and robust dose mimicking.
  Methods: The scenario dose prediction pipeline is divided into the prediction of nominal dose from input image and the prediction of scenario dose from nominal dose, each using a deep learning model with U-net architecture. By using a specially developed dose-volume histogram-based loss function, the predicted scenario doses are ensured sufficient target coverage despite the possibility of the training data being non-robust. Deliverable plans may then be created by solving a robust dose mimicking problem with the predictions as scenario-specific reference doses.
  Results: Numerical experiments are performed using a dataset of 52 intensity-modulated proton therapy plans for prostate patients. We show that the predicted scenario doses resemble their respective ground truth well, in particular while having target coverage comparable to that of the nominal scenario. The deliverable plans produced by the subsequent robust dose mimicking were showed to be robust against the same scenario set considered for prediction.

Multiscale Monte Carlo simulations of gold nanoparticle dose-enhanced radiotherapy II. Cellular dose enhancement within macroscopic tumor models,"Martin P. Martinov, Elizabeth M. Fletcher, Rowan M. Thomson","Purpose: To develop and apply multiscale Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to assess variations in nucleus and cytoplasm dose enhancement factors (n,cDEFs) over tumor-scale volumes. Methods: The intrinsic variation of n,cDEFs (due to variations in local gold concentration and cell/nucleus size) are estimated via MC modeling of varied cellular GNP uptake and cell/nucleus sizes. Then, a Heterogeneous MultiScale (HetMS) model is implemented by combining detailed models of populations of cells containing GNPs with simplified tissue models to evaluate n,cDEFs. Simulations of tumors with spatially-uniform and -varying gold concentrations are performed to determine n,cDEFs as a function of distance from the source. All simulations are performed for three different GNP configurations: GNPs distributed around the nucleus or packed into one or four endosome(s). Results: Intrinsic variations in n,cDEFs can be substantial with changes in GNP uptake and cell/nucleus radii. In HetMS models of tumors, sub-unity n,cDEFs (dose decreases) can occur for low energies and high gold concentrations due to attenuation of primary photons through the gold. In HetMS simulations of tumors with spatially-uniform gold concentrations, n,cDEFs decrease with depth into the tumor as photons are attenuated, with relative differences between GNP models remaining approximately constant with depth in the tumor. Similar initial n,cDEF decreases with radius are seen in tumors with spatially-varying gold concentrations, but n,cDEFs for all configurations converge to a single value for each energy as gold concentration reaches zero. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that cellular doses are highly sensitive to cell/nucleus size, GNP intracellular distribution, gold concentration, and cell position in the tumor.

Dosimetric characterization of single- and dual-port temporary tissue expanders for postmastectomy radiotherapy using Monte Carlo methods,"Jose Ramos-Méndez, Catherine Park, Manju Sharma","Purpose: The aim of this work was, a) to assess two treatment planning strategies for accounting CT-artifacts introduced by temporary tissue-expanders(TTEs); b) to evaluate the dosimetric impact of two commercially available and one novel TTE. MethodsThe CT artifacts were managed using two strategies. 1) Identifying the metal in the RayStation treatment planning software (TPS) using image window level adjustments, delineate a contour enclosing the artifact, and setting the density of the surrounding voxels to unity (RS1). 2) Registering a geometry template with dimensions and materials from the TTEs (RS2). Both strategies were compared for DermaSpan, AlloX2, and AlloX2-Pro TTEs using Collapsed-Cone-Convolution (CCC) in RayStation TPS, Monte Carlo simulations (MC) using TOPAS, and films. Wax slab phantoms with TTEs and breast phantoms with TTEs balloons were made and irradiated with a 6 MV AP beam and partial arc, respectively. Results: For the wax slab phantoms, the dose differences between RS1 and RS2 were 0.5% for DermaSpan and AlloX2 but 3% for AlloX2-Pro. From TOPAS simulations of RS2, the impact in dose distributions caused by the magnet attenuation was (6.4+-0.4)%, (4.9+-0.7)%, and (2.0+-0.9)% for DermaSpan, AlloX2, and AlloX2-Pro. With breast phantoms, maximum differences in DVH parameters between RS1 and RS2 were as follows.

The work is presented in two parts, with Part I (this work) investigating accurate and efficient MC modeling to calculate nucleus and cytoplasm Dose Enhancement Factors (n,cDEFs). Part II then evaluates cell dose enhancement factors across macroscopic length scales. Methods: Different methods of modeling gold within cells are compared: a contiguous volume of either pure gold or gold-tissue mixture or discrete GNPs. MC simulations with EGSnrc are performed to calculate n,cDEF for a cell considering 10 to 370 keV incident photons, gold concentrations from 4 to 24~mg of gold per gram, and three different GNP configurations: GNPs distributed around the surface of the nucleus or packed into one or four endosomes. Results: n,cDEFs are sensitive to the model of gold in the cell, with differences of up to 17% observed between models. Across cell/nucleus radii, source energies, and gold concentrations, n,cDEF are highest for GNPs in the perinuclear configuration, compared with GNPs in endosomes. Across all simulations of the default cell, nDEFs and cDEFs range from one to 6.83 and 3.87, respectively. If the cell size is changed, much higher n,cDEFs are observed. n,cDEF are maximized at photon energies at or just above the K- or L-edges of gold. Conclusions: This work demonstrates many physics trends on DEFs at the cellular level, including that cellular DEFs are sensitive to gold modeling approach, GNP configuration, cell/nucleus size, gold concentration, and incident source energy. These data will allow one to optimize or estimate DEF using not only GNP uptake, but account for incident photon energy and intracellular configuration of GNPs.

On-line Dose Calculation Using Deep Learning for Beams Selection in Non-Coplanar Radiotherapy,"Fang Guo, Franklin Okoli, Ulrike Schick, Dimitris Visvikis, Antoine Valeri, Julien Bert","Non-coplanar Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) goes a step further by orienting the gantry carrying the radiation beam and the patient couch in a non-coplanar manner to accurately target the cancer region and better avoid organs-at-risk. The use of a non-coplanar treatment trajectory significantly enhances the degree of freedom and flexibility but increases drastically the complexity of the optimization. In inverse planning optimization the dose contribution for all potential beam directions is usually pre-calculates and pre-loads into the Treatment Planning System (TPS). The size the dose matrix becomes more critical when moving from coplanar IMRT to non-coplanar IMRT since the number of beams increases drastically. A solution would be to calculate ""on-the-fly"" the dose contribution to each new candidate beam during optimization. This is only possible if a dose calculation engine is fast enough to be used online during optimization iterations, which is not the case in standard method. Therefore, in this work we propose an IMRT optimization scheme using deep learning based dose engine to compute the dose matrix on-line. The proposed deep learning approach will be combined into a simulated-annealing-based optimization method for non-coplanar IMRT. Since the dose engine will compute the dose contribution on-line during the optimization, the final main optimization method requires to keep in memory a very lightweight dose matrix. The proposed method was compared with clinical data showing a good agreement considering dosimetry of the treatment plans.

There were three major innovations in this model: 1) we designed an architecture with squeeze-and-excite blocks and modality attention for effective feature extraction and production of accurate segmentation, 2) a novel loss function was used for training the model effectively with noisy labels, and 3) modality dropout strategy was used for making the model capable of segmentation in the absence of MRI. Results: The DSC, ASD, and HD95 values for the test dataset were 62.2%, 2.54mm, and 7mm, respectively. AI segmented contours were dosimetrically equivalent to the expert physician's contours. The observer study showed that expert physicians' scored AI contours (mean=3.7) higher than inexperienced physicians' contours (mean=3.1). When inexperienced physicians started with AI contours, the score improved to 3.7. Conclusion: The proposed model achieved good quality IPA contours to improve uniformity of segmentation and to facilitate introduction of standardized IPA segmentation into clinical trials and practice.","Image and Video Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Medical Physics","2 February, 2023",2302.01493,,"@misc{2302.01493,

deepPERFECT: Novel Deep Learning CT Synthesis Method for Expeditious Pancreatic Cancer Radiotherapy,"Hamed Hooshangnejad, Quan Chen, Xue Feng, Rui Zhang, Kai Ding","Pancreatic cancer with more than 60,000 new cases each year has less than 10 percent 5-year overall survival. Radiation therapy (RT) is an effective treatment for Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The current clinical RT workflow is lengthy and involves separate image acquisition for diagnostic CT (dCT) and planning CT (pCT). Studies have shown a reduction in mortality rate from expeditious radiotherapy treatment. dCT and pCT are acquired separately because of the differences in the image acquisition setup and patient body. We are presenting deepPERFECT: deep learning-based model to adapt the shape of the patient body on dCT to the treatment delivery setup. Our method expedites the treatment course by allowing the design of the initial RT planning before the pCT acquisition. Thus, the physicians can evaluate the potential RT prognosis ahead of time, verify the plan on the treatment day-one CT and apply any online adaptation if needed. We used the data from 25 pancreatic cancer patients. The model was trained on 15 cases and tested on the remaining ten cases. We evaluated the performance of four different deep-learning architectures for this task. The synthesized CT (sCT) and regions of interest (ROIs) were compared with ground truth (pCT) using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD). We found that the three-dimensional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on large patches has the best performance. The average DSC and HD for body contours were 0.93, and 4.6 mm. We found no statistically significant difference between the synthesized CT plans and the ground truth.

Here we validate these three quantities under FLASH conditions, which includes the quantum uncertainty in the time-dependent instantaneous dose rate (IDR) curves and LET spectra that underlie the newly proposed integrated optimization framework.
  Measurements of dose, IDR, and LET were performed at the Emory Proton Therapy Center using a FLASH proton beam with a nominal energy of 250 MeV and a 3D printed ridge filter. Because 3D printing resin is made from a proprietary chemical formula, we developed a method for realistically characterizing and modeling the material in simulations. Absolute dose in 3D space was measured using a 2D MatriXX PT detector as well as by a novel 4D multi-layer strip ionization chamber (MLSIC), which also simultaneously measures IDR. Further timing data was measured in the secondary beam by detecting prompt gammas using a Minipix Timepix3; a second detector, Advapix Timepix3, was used to measure LET. To account for the quantum mechanical nature of particle transport, we developed a technique for detecting individual protons within a high flux primary beam, which was necessary for properly measuring LET spectra.
  TOPAS simulations agreed with measurement, with absolute dose typically having a gamma passing rate of at least 95% (3 mm/3% criteria). Likewise, IDR and LET showed good agreement, with averaged IDR values agreeing within 0.3% with fluctuations on the order of 10%, and LET distributions overlapping by at least 85% and showing an increase in high LET components (greater than 4 keV/um) with increasing depth.

Forecasting per-patient dosimetric benefit from daily online adaptive radiotherapy for cervical cancer,"Rupesh Ghimire, Kevin L. Moore, Daniela Branco, Dominique L.

However, ART is also resource-intensive, requiring extra human and machine time compared to standard treatment methods. In this analysis, we sought to predict the subset of node-negative cervical cancer patients who benefit the most from ART. CT images, initial plan data, and on-treatment Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) images for 20 retrospective cervical cancer patients were used to simulate doses from daily non-adaptive and adaptive techniques. We evaluated the correlation (R$^2$) between dose and volume metrics from initial treatment plans and the dosimetric benefits to the Bowel V$_{40Gy}$, Bowel V$_{45Gy}$, Bladder D$_{mean}$, and Rectum D$_{mean}$ from adaptive radiotherapy using reduced 3mm or 5mm CTV-to-PTV margins. The LASSO technique was used to identify the most predictive metrics for Bowel V$_{40Gy}$. The three highest performing metrics were used to build multivariate models with leave-one-out validation for Bowel V$_{40Gy}$. Patients with higher initial bowel doses were correlated with the largest decreases in Bowel V$_{40Gy}$ from daily adaptation (linear best fit R$^2$=0.77 for a 3mm PTV margin and R$^2$=0.8 for a 5mm PTV margin). Other metrics had intermediate or no correlation. Selected covariates for the multivariate model were differences in the initial Bowel V$_{40Gy}$. and Bladder D$_{mean}$ using standard versus reduced margins and the initial bladder volume. Leave-one-out validation had an R$^2$ of 0.66 between the predicted and true adaptive Bowel V$_{40Gy}$ benefits for both margins.

Implications of Clinical Target Distribution Weighted Radiotherapy Optimization,"Ivar Bengtsson, Anders Forsgren, Albin Fredriksson","Delineating and planning with respect to regions suspected to contain microscopic tumor cells is an inherently uncertain task in radiotherapy. The recently proposed \textit{clinical target distribution} (CTD) is an alternative to the conventional \textit{clinical target volume} (CTV), with initial promise. Previously, using the CTD in planning has primarily been evaluated in comparison to a conventionally defined CTV. We propose to compare the CTD approach against CTV margins of various sizes, dependent on the threshold at which the tumor infiltration probability is considered relevant. First, a theoretical framework is presented, concerned with optimizing the trade-off between the probability of sufficient target coverage and the penalties associated with high dose. From this framework we derive conventional CTV-based planning and contrast it with the CTD approach. The approaches are contextualized further by comparison with established methods for managing geometric uncertainties. Second, for both a one- and a three-dimensional phantom, we compare a set of CTD plans created by varying the target objective function weight against a set of plans created by varying both the target weight and the CTV margin size. The results show that CTD-based planning gives slightly inefficient trade-offs between the evaluation criteria for a case in which near-minimum target dose is the highest priority. However, in a case when sparing a proximal organ at risk is critical, the CTD is better at maintaining sufficiently high dose toward the center of the target. We conclude that CTD-based planning is a computationally efficient method for planning with respect to delineation uncertainties, but that the inevitable effects on the dose distribution should not be disregarded.","Medical Physics, Optimization and Control","12 October, 2022",2210.06049,10.1088/1361-6560/acc77b,"@misc{2210.06049,

Feasibility Study of Hybrid Inverse Planning with Transmission Beams and Single-energy Spread-out Bragg Peaks for Proton Flash Radiotherapy,"Chaoqiong Ma, Xiaofeng Yang, Chih-Wei Chang, Ruirui Liu, Duncan Bohannon, Liyong Lin, Tian Liu, Sibo Tian, Jun Zhou","Ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) proton planning with only transmission beams (TBs) has limitations in normal tissue sparing. The single-energy spread-out Bragg peaks (SESOBPs) of FLASH dose rate have been demonstrated feasible for proton FLASH planning. A hybrid inverse optimization method was developed to combine the TBs and SESOBPs (TB-SESOBP) for FLASH planning. The SESOBPs were generated from spreading out the BPs by pre-designed general bar ridge filters and placed at the central target by range shifters to obtain a uniform dose within the target. The SESOBPs and TBs were fully sampled field-by-field allowing automatic spot selection and weighting in the optimization process. The TB-SESOBP plans were validated in comparison with the TB only (TB-only) plans and the plans with the combination of TBs and BPs (TB-BP) regarding 3D dose and dose rate distributions for five lung cases. Comparing to the TB-only plans, the mean spinal cord D1.2cc drastically reduced 41%, the mean lung V7Gy and V7.4Gy moderately reduced by up to 17% and the target dose homogeneity slightly increased in the TB-SESOBP plans. Comparable dose homogeneity was achieved in both TB-SESOBP and TB-BP plans. Besides, prominent improvements were achieved in lung sparing for the cases of relatively large targets by the TB-SESOBP plans comparing to the TB-BP plans. The targets were fully covered with the FLASH dose rate in all the three plans. For the OARs, V40Gy/s = 100% was achieved by the TB-only plans while V40Gy/s > 85% was obtained by the other two plans. We have demonstrated that the hybrid TB-SESOBP planning was feasible to achieve FLASH dose rate for proton therapy.

A probabilistic deep learning model of inter-fraction anatomical variations in radiotherapy,"Oscar Pastor-Serrano, Steven Habraken, Mischa Hoogeman, Danny Lathouwers, Dennis Schaart, Yusuke Nomura, Lei Xing, Zoltán Perkó","In radiotherapy, the internal movement of organs between treatment sessions causes errors in the final radiation dose delivery. Motion models can be used to simulate motion patterns and assess anatomical robustness before delivery. Traditionally, such models are based on principal component analysis (PCA) and are either patient-specific (requiring several scans per patient) or population-based, applying the same deformations to all patients. We present a hybrid approach which, based on population data, allows to predict patient-specific inter-fraction variations for an individual patient. We propose a deep learning probabilistic framework that generates deformation vector fields (DVFs) warping a patient's planning computed tomography (CT) into possible patient-specific anatomies. This daily anatomy model (DAM) uses few random variables capturing groups of correlated movements. Given a new planning CT, DAM estimates the joint distribution over the variables, with each sample from the distribution corresponding to a different deformation. We train our model using dataset of 312 CT pairs from 38 prostate cancer patients. For 2 additional patients (22 CTs), we compute the contour overlap between real and generated images, and compare the sampled and ground truth distributions of volume and center of mass changes. With a DICE score of 0.86 and a distance between prostate contours of 1.09 mm, DAM matches and improves upon PCA-based models. The distribution overlap further indicates that DAM's sampled movements match the range and frequency of clinically observed daily changes on repeat CTs. Conditioned only on a planning CT and contours of a new patient without any pre-processing, DAM can accurately predict CTs seen during following treatment sessions, which can be used for anatomically robust treatment planning and robustness evaluation against inter-fraction anatomical changes.",Medical Physics,"20 September, 2022",2209.09583,10.1088/1361-6560/acc71d,"@misc{2209.09583,

The STN consists of a global generative adversarial network (GlobalGAN) and a local GAN (LocalGAN) to predict the coarse- and fine-scale motions, respectively. The network was trained by minimizing the image similarity loss and the deformable vector field (DVF) regularization loss without the supervision of ground truth DVFs. During the inference stage, patches of local DVF were predicted by the trained LocalGAN and fused to form a whole-image DVF. The local whole-image DVF was subsequently combined with the GlobalGAN generated DVF to obtain final DVF. The proposed method was evaluated using 100 fractional CBCTs from 20 abdominal cancer patients in the experiments and 105 fractional CBCTs from a cohort of 21 different abdominal cancer patients in a holdout test. Qualitatively, the registration results show great alignment between the deformed CBCT images and the target CBCT image. Quantitatively, the average target registration error (TRE) calculated on the fiducial markers and manually identified landmarks was 1.91+-1.11 mm. The average mean absolute error (MAE), normalized cross correlation (NCC) between the deformed CBCT and target CBCT were 33.42+-7.48 HU, 0.94+-0.04, respectively. This promising registration method could provide fast and accurate longitudinal CBCT alignment to facilitate inter-fractional anatomic changes analysis and prediction.","Image and Video Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Medical Physics","29 August, 2022",2208.13686,10.1088/1361-6560/acc721,"@misc{2208.13686,

The superiorization method with restarted perturbations for split minimization problems with an application to radiotherapy treatment planning,"Francisco J. Aragón-Artacho, Yair Censor, Aviv Gibali, David Torregrosa-Belén","In this paper we study the split minimization problem that consists of two constrained minimization problems in two separate spaces that are connected via a linear operator that maps one space into the other. To handle the data of such a problem we develop a superiorization approach that can reach a feasible point with reduced (not necessarily minimal) objective function values. The superiorization methodology is based on interlacing the iterative steps of two separate and independent iterative processes by perturbing the iterates of one process according to the steps dictated by the other process. We include in our developed method two novel elements. The first one is the permission to restart the perturbations in the superiorized algorithm which results in a significant acceleration and increases the computational efficiency. The second element is the ability to independently superiorize subvectors. This caters to the needs of real-world applications, as demonstrated here for a problem in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.","Optimization and Control, Medical Physics","10 October, 2022",2207.05663,,"@misc{2207.05663,

Superiorization as a novel strategy for linearly constrained inverse radiotherapy treatment planning,"Florian Barkmann, Yair Censor, Niklas Wahl","We apply the superiorization methodology to the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning problem. In superiorization, linear voxel dose inequality constraints are the fundamental modeling tool within which a feasibility-seeking projection algorithm will seek a feasible point. This algorithm is then perturbed with gradient descent steps to reduce a nonlinear objective function. Within the open-source inverse planning toolkit matRad, we implement a prototypical algorithmic framework for superiorization using the well-established Agmon, Motzkin, and Schoenberg (AMS) feasibility-seeking projection algorithm and common nonlinear dose optimization objective functions. Based on this prototype, we apply superiorization to intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning and compare its performance with feasibility-seeking and nonlinear constrained optimization. For these comparisons, we use the TG119 water phantom and a head-and-neck patient of the CORT dataset. Bare feasibility-seeking with AMS confirms previous studies, showing it can find solutions that are nearly equivalent to those found by the established piece-wise least-squares optimization approach. The superiorization prototype solved the linearly constrained planning problem with similar performance to that of a general-purpose nonlinear constrained optimizer while showing smooth convergence in both constraint proximity and objective function reduction. Superiorization is a useful alternative to constrained optimization in radiotherapy inverse treatment planning. Future extensions with other approaches to feasibility-seeking, e.g., with dose-volume constraints and more sophisticated perturbations, may unlock its full potential for high-performant inverse treatment planning.","Medical Physics, Optimization and Control","26 July, 2022",2207.13187,,"@misc{2207.13187,

Learning Image Representations for Content Based Image Retrieval of Radiotherapy Treatment Plans,"Charles Huang, Varun Vasudevan, Oscar Pastor-Serrano, Md Tauhidul Islam, Yusuke Nomura, Piotr Dubrowski, Jen-Yeu Wang, Joseph B. Schulz, Yong Yang, Lei Xing","Objective: Knowledge based planning (KBP) typically involves training an end-to-end deep learning model to predict dose distributions. However, training end-to-end methods may be associated with practical limitations due to the limited size of medical datasets that are often used. To address these limitations, we propose a content based image retrieval (CBIR) method for retrieving dose distributions of previously planned patients based on anatomical similarity. Approach: Our proposed CBIR method trains a representation model that produces latent space embeddings of a patient's anatomical information. The latent space embeddings of new patients are then compared against those of previous patients in a database for image retrieval of dose distributions. All source code for this project is available on github. Main Results: The retrieval performance of various CBIR methods is evaluated on a dataset consisting of both publicly available plans and clinical plans from our institution. This study compares various encoding methods, ranging from simple autoencoders to more recent Siamese networks like SimSiam, and the best performance was observed for the multitask Siamese network. Significance: Applying CBIR to inform subsequent treatment planning potentially addresses many limitations associated with end-to-end KBP. Our current results demonstrate that excellent image retrieval performance can be obtained through slight changes to previously developed Siamese networks. We hope to integrate CBIR into automated planning workflow in future works, potentially through methods like the MetaPlanner framework.","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Medical Physics","23 August, 2022",2206.02912,,"@misc{2206.02912,

Deep Learning based Direct Segmentation Assisted by Deformable Image Registration for Cone-Beam CT based Auto-Segmentation for Adaptive Radiotherapy,"Xiao Liang, Howard Morgan, Ti Bai, Michael Dohopolski, Dan Nguyen, Steve Jiang","Cone-beam CT (CBCT)-based online adaptive radiotherapy calls for accurate auto-segmentation to reduce the time cost for physicians to edit contours. However, deep learning (DL)-based direct segmentation of CBCT images is a challenging task, mainly due to the poor image quality and lack of well-labelled large training datasets. Deformable image registration (DIR) is often used to propagate the manual contours on the planning CT (pCT) of the same patient to CBCT. In this work, we undertake solving the problems mentioned above with the assistance of DIR. Our method consists of three main components. First, we use deformed pCT contours derived from multiple DIR methods between pCT and CBCT as pseudo labels for initial training of the DL-based direct segmentation model. Second, we use deformed pCT contours from another DIR algorithm as influencer volumes to define the region of interest for DL-based direct segmentation. Third, the initially trained DL model is further fine-tuned using a smaller set of true labels. We found that DL-based direct segmentation on CBCT trained with pseudo labels and without influencer volumes shows poor performance compared to DIR-based segmentation. However, adding deformed pCT contours as influencer volumes in the direct segmentation network dramatically improves segmentation performance, reaching the accuracy level of DIR-based segmentation. The DL model with influencer volumes can be further improved through fine-tuning using a smaller set of true labels. Experiments showed that 7 out of 19 structures have an at least 0.2 Dice similarity coefficient increase compared to DIR-based segmentation. A DL-based direct CBCT segmentation model can be improved to outperform DIR-based segmentation models by using deformed pCT contours as pseudo labels and influencer volumes for initial training, and by using a smaller set of true labels for model fine tuning.","Medical Physics, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","10 October, 2022",2206.03413,10.1088/1361-6560/acb4d7,"@misc{2206.03413,

Low noise optimization of an electron beam current transformer for conventional radiotherapy up to ultra high dose rate irradiations,"Chloe Lahaye, Jean-Marc Fontbonne, Samuel Salvador","Ultra high dose rate electron beams also known as FLASH radiotherapy is becoming of importance in several preclinial cancer treatment studies. However, due to the dose rate used during the irradiation sessions, no real time dose monitoring device exists to date. In this work, we present the development of a beam current transformer (BCT), from the choice of the ferromagnetic component and the realisation of the shielding to the design of a front-end electronics based on a trans-impedance circuit in order to perform a low noise optimization of the detector. The BCT prototype is able to monitor a beam current range from 1.2~\textmu A to 200~mA with a rise time constant better than 20~ns and a droop rate of the signal below 0.05\%$\cdot$\textmu s$^{-1}$.

Predicting regrowth of low-grade gliomas after radiotherapy,"Stephane Plaszczynski, Basile Grammaticos, Johan Pallud, Jean-Eric Campagne, Mathilde Badoual","Diffuse low grade gliomas are invasive and incurable brain tumours that inevitably transform into higher grade ones. A classical treatment to delay this transition is radiotherapy (RT). Following RT, the tumour gradually shrinks during a period of typically 6 months to 4 years before regrowing. To improve the patient's health-related quality of life and help clinicians build personalised follow-ups, one would benefit from predictions of the time during which the tumour is expected to decrease. The challenge is to provide a reliable estimate of this regrowth time shortly after RT (i.e. with few data), although patients react differently to the treatment. To this end, we analyse the tumour size dynamics from a batch of 20 high-quality longitudinal data, and propose a simple and robust analytical model, with just 4 parameters. From the study of their correlations, we build a statistical constraint that helps determine the regrowth time even for patients for which we have only a few measurements of the tumour size. We validate the procedure on the data and predict the regrowth time at the moment of the first MRI after RT, with precision of, typically, 6 months. Using virtual patients, we study whether some forecast is still possible just three months after RT. We obtain some reliable estimates of the regrowth time in 75\% of the cases, in particular for all ""fast-responders"". The remaining 25\% represent cases where the actual regrowth time is large and can be safely estimated with another measurement a year later. These results show the feasibility of making personalised predictions of the tumour regrowth time shortly after RT.",Medical Physics,"15 June, 2022",2206.07401,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011002,"@misc{2206.07401,

Modeling the impact of spatial oxygen heterogeneity on radiolytic oxygen depletion during FLASH radiotherapy,"Edward Taylor, Richard P. Hill, Daniel Letourneau","It has been postulated that the delivery of radiotherapy at ultra-high dose rates (""FLASH"") reduces normal tissue toxicities by depleting them of oxygen. The fraction of normal tissue and cancer cells surviving radiotherapy depends on dose and oxygen levels in an exponential manner and even a very small fraction of tissue at low oxygen levels can determine radiotherapy response. The effect of FLASH on radiation-induced normal and tumour tissue cell killing was studied by simulating oxygen diffusion, metabolism, and radiolytic oxygen depletion over domains with simulated capillary architectures. Two architectural models were used: 1.) randomly distributed capillaries and 2.) capillaries forming a regular square lattice array. The resulting oxygen partial pressure distribution histograms were used to simulate normal and tumour tissue cell survival using the linear quadratic model of cell survival, modified to incorporate oxygen-enhancement ratio (OER) effects. Tumour cell survival was found to be increased by FLASH as compared to conventional radiotherapy, with a 0-1 order of magnitude increase for expected levels of tumour hypoxia, depending on the relative magnitudes of radiolytic oxygen depletion and tissue oxygen metabolism. Interestingly, for the random capillary model, the impact of FLASH on well-oxygenated (normal) tissues was found to be much greater, with an estimated increase in cell survival by up to 10 orders of magnitude, even though reductions in mean tissue partial pressure were modest, less than 7 mmHg for the parameter values studied. The presence of very small nearly hypoxic regions in otherwise well-perfused normal tissues with high mean oxygen levels resulted in a greater proportional sparing of normal tissue than tumour cells during FLASH irradiation, possibly explaining empirical normal tissue sparing and iso-tumour control results.",Medical Physics,"16 May, 2022",2205.08053,10.1088/1361-6560/ac702c,"@misc{2205.08053,

Additionally we summarised the most recent developments. To reproduce results of deep learning algorithms both source code and training data must be available. Therefore, a second focus of this work was on the analysis of the availability of open source, open data and open models. In our analysis, we were able to show that deep learning plays already a major role in some areas of interventional radiotherapy, but is still hardly presented in others. Nevertheless, its impact is increasing with the years, partly self-propelled but also influenced by closely related fields. Open source, data and models are growing in number but are still scarce and unevenly distributed among different research groups. The reluctance in publishing code, data and models limits reproducibility and restricts evaluation to mono-institutional datasets.

Gaussian Processes for real-time 3D motion and uncertainty estimation during MR-guided radiotherapy,"Niek R. F. Huttinga, Tom Bruijnen, Cornelis A. T. van den Berg, Alessandro Sbrizzi","Respiratory motion during radiotherapy causes uncertainty in the tumor's location, which is typically addressed by an increased radiation area and a decreased dose. As a result, the treatments' efficacy is reduced. The recently proposed hybrid MR-linac scanner holds the promise to efficiently deal with such respiratory motion through real-time adaptive MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT). For MRgRT, motion-fields should be estimated from MR-data and the radiotherapy plan should be adapted in real-time according to the estimated motion-fields. All of this should be performed with a total latency of maximally 200 ms, including data acquisition and reconstruction. A measure of confidence in such estimated motion-fields is highly desirable, for instance to ensure the patient's safety in case of unexpected and undesirable motion. In this work, we propose a framework based on Gaussian Processes to infer 3D motion-fields and uncertainty maps in real-time from only three readouts of MR-data. We demonstrated an inference frame rate up to 69 Hz including data acquisition and reconstruction, thereby exploiting the limited amount of required MR-data. Additionally, we designed a rejection criterion based on the motion-field uncertainty maps to demonstrate the framework's potential for quality assurance. The framework was validated in silico and in vivo on healthy volunteer data (n=5) acquired using an MR-linac, thereby taking into account different breathing patterns and controlled bulk motion. Results indicate end-point-errors with a 75th percentile below 1mm in silico, and a correct detection of erroneous motion estimates with the rejection criterion.

A simple mathematical model of cyclic hypoxia and its impact on hypofractionated radiotherapy,Edward Taylor,"There is evidence that the population of cells that experience fluctuating oxygen levels are more radioresistant than chronically hypoxic ones and hence, this population may determine radiotherapy (RT) response, in particular for hypofractionated RT, where reoxygenation may not be as prominent. A considerable effort has been devoted to examining the impact of hypoxia on hypofractionated RT; however, much less attention has been paid to cyclic hypoxia specifically and the role its kinetics may play in determining the efficacy of these treatments. Here, a simple mathematical model of cyclic hypoxia and fractionation effects was worked out to quantify this. Cancer clonogen survival fraction was estimated using the linear quadratic model, modified to account for oxygen enhancement effects and inter-fraction tissue oxygen kinetics. The resulting survival fraction formula was used to derive an expression for the iso-survival biologically effective dose, $\bedeff$. These were computed for some common extra-cranial hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens. Using relevant literature parameter values, inter-fraction fluctuations in oxygenation were found to result in an added 1-2 logs of clonogen survival fraction in going from five fractions to one for the same nominal biologically effective dose. $\bedeff$'s for most ultra-hypofractionated (five or fewer fractions) regimens in a given tumour site are similar in magnitude, suggesting iso-efficacy for common fractionation schedules. Although significant, the loss of cell-killing with increasing hypofractionation is not nearly as large as previous estimates based on the assumption of complete reoxygenation between fractions. Most ultra-hypofractionated regimens currently in place offer sufficiently high doses to counter this loss of cell killing, although care should be taken in implementing single-fraction regimens.",Medical Physics,"24 March, 2023",2204.08527,10.1002/mp.16200,"@misc{2204.08527,

Fast and accurate dose predictions for novel radiotherapy treatments in heterogeneous phantoms using conditional 3D-UNet generative adversarial networks,"Florian Mentzel, Kevin Kröninger, Michael Lerch, Olaf Nackenhorst, Jason Paino, Anatoly Rosenfeld, Ayu Saraswati, Ah Chung Tsoi, Jens Weingarten, Markus Hagenbuchner, Susanna Guatelli","Novel radiotherapy techniques like synchrotron X-ray microbeam radiation therapy (MRT), require fast dose distribution predictions that are accurate at the sub-mm level, especially close to tissue/bone/air interfaces. Monte Carlo physics simulations are recognised to be one of the most accurate tools to predict the dose delivered in a target tissue but can be very time consuming and therefore prohibitive for treatment planning. Faster dose prediction algorithms are usually developed for clinically deployed treatments only. In this work, we explore a new approach for fast and accurate dose estimations suitable for novel treatments using digital phantoms used in pre-clinical development and modern machine learning techniques. We develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, which is able to emulate the equivalent Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation with adequate accuracy, and use it to predict the radiation dose delivered by a broad synchrotron beam to various phantoms. The energy depositions used for the training of the GAN are obtained using full Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations of a synchrotron radiation broad beam passing through the phantoms. The energy deposition is scored and predicted in voxel matrices of size 140x18x18 with a voxel edge length of 1 mm. The GAN model consists of two competing 3D convolutional neural networks, which are conditioned on the photon beam and phantom properties. The energy deposition predictions inside all phantom geometries under investigation show deviations of less than 3% of the maximum deposited energy from the simulation for roughly 99% of the voxels in the field of the beam. The computing time for a single prediction is reduced from several hundred hours using Geant4 simulation to less than a second using the GAN model.",Medical Physics,"16 February, 2022",2202.07077,10.1002/mp.15555,"@misc{2202.07077,

Evaluation of indirect damage and damage saturation effects in dose-response curves of hypofractionated radiotherapy of early-stage NSCLC and brain metastases,"Araceli Gago-Arias, Sara Neira, Miguel Pombar, Antonio Gómez-Caamaño, Juan Pardo-Montero","Background and purpose: To investigate the possible contribution of indirect damage and damage saturation to tumour control obtained with SBRT/SRS treatments for early-stage NSCLC and brain metastases. Methods and Materials: We have constructed a dataset of early-stage NSCLC and brain metastases dose-response. These data were fitted to models based on the linear-quadratic (LQ), the linear-quadratic-linear (LQL), and phenomenological modifications of the LQ-model to account for indirect cell damage. We use the Akaike-Information-Criterion formalism to compare performance, and studied the stability of the results with changes in fitting parameters and perturbations on dose/TCP values.
  Results: In NSCLC, a modified LQ-model with a beta-term increasing with dose yields the best-fits for $α$/$β$=10 Gy. Only the inclusion of very fast accelerated proliferation or low $α$/$β$ values can eliminate such superiority. In brain, the LQL model yields the best-fits, and the ranking is not affected by variations of fitting parameters or dose/TCP perturbations.
  Conclusions: For $α$/$β$=10 Gy, a modified LQ-model with a beta-term increasing with dose provides better fits to NSCLC dose-response curves. For brain metastases, the LQL provides the best fit. This might be interpreted as a hint of indirect damage in NSCLC, and damage saturation in brain metastases. The results for NSCLC are strongly dependent on the value of $α$/$β$ and may require further investigation, while those for brain seem to be clearly significant. Our results can assist in the design of improved radiotherapy for NSCLC and brain metastases, aiming at avoiding over/under-treatment.",Medical Physics,"10 February, 2022",2202.04953,,"@misc{2202.04953,

First implementation of full-workflow automation in radiotherapy : the All-in-One solution on rectal cancer,"Lei Yu, Jun Zhao, Fan Xia, Zhiyuan Zhang, Yanfang Liu, Wei Zhang, Jingjie Zhou, Jiazhou Wang, Weigang Hu, Zhen Zhang","The aim of this work is to describe the technical characteristics of an AI-powered radiotherapy workflow that enables full-process automation (All-in-One), evaluate its performance implemented for on-couch initial treatment of rectal cancer, and provide insight into the behavior of full-workflow automation in the specialty of radiotherapy. The All-in-One workflow was developed based on a CT-integrated linear accelerator. It incorporates routine radiotherapy procedures from simulation, autosegmentation, autoplanning, image guidance, beam delivery, and in vivo quality assurance (QA) into one scheme, with critical decision points involved, while the patient is on the treatment couch during the whole process. For the enrolled ten patients with rectal cancer, minor modifications of the autosegmented target volumes were required, and the Dice similarity coefficient and 95% Hausdorff distance before and after modifications were 0.892{\pm}0.061 and 18.2{\pm}13.0 mm, respectively. The autosegmented normal tissues and automatic plans were clinically acceptable without any modifications or reoptimization. The pretreatment IGRT corrections were within 2 mm in all directions, and the EPID-based in vivo QA showed a γ passing rate better than 97{\%} (3{\%}/3 mm/10{\%} threshold). The duration of the whole process was 23.2{\pm}3.5 minutes, depending mostly on the time required for manual modification and plan evaluation. The All-in-One workflow enables full automation of the entire radiotherapy process by seamlessly integrating multiple routine procedures. The one-stop solution shortens the time scale it takes to ready the first treatment from days to minutes, significantly improving the patient experience and the efficiency of the workflow, and shows potential to facilitate the clinical application of online adaptive replanning.",Medical Physics,"24 February, 2022",2202.12009,,"@misc{2202.12009,

On Real-time Image Reconstruction with Neural Networks for MRI-guided Radiotherapy,"David E. J. Waddington, Nicholas Hindley, Neha Koonjoo, Christopher Chiu, Tess Reynolds, Paul Z. Y. Liu, Bo Zhu, Danyal Bhutto, Chiara Paganelli, Paul J. Keall, Matthew S.

The gold-standard for reconstruction of undersampled MR data is compressed sensing (CS) which is computationally slow and limits the rate that images can be available for real-time adaptation. Here, we demonstrate the use of automated transform by manifold approximation (AUTOMAP), a generalized framework that maps raw MR signal to the target image domain, to rapidly reconstruct images from undersampled radial k-space data. The AUTOMAP neural network was trained to reconstruct images from a golden-angle radial acquisition, a benchmark for motion-sensitive imaging, on lung cancer patient data and generic images from ImageNet. Model training was subsequently augmented with motion-encoded k-space data derived from videos in the YouTube-8M dataset to encourage motion robust reconstruction. We find that AUTOMAP-reconstructed radial k-space has equivalent accuracy to CS but with much shorter processing times after initial fine-tuning on retrospectively acquired lung cancer patient data. Validation of motion-trained models with a virtual dynamic lung tumor phantom showed that the generalized motion properties learned from YouTube lead to improved target tracking accuracy. Our work shows that AUTOMAP can achieve real-time, accurate reconstruction of radial data. These findings imply that neural-network-based reconstruction is potentially superior to existing approaches for real-time image guidance applications.","Medical Physics, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Image and Video Processing","18 May, 2022",2202.05267,,"@misc{2202.05267,

CNAO Foundation, INFN and University of Torino have developed and commissioned a Dose Delivery System (DDS) to monitor and guide ion beams accelerated by a synchrotron and to distribute the dose with a 3D scanning technique. The target volume, segmented in several layers orthogonally to the beam direction, is irradiated by thousands of pencil beams which must be steered and held to the prescribed positions until the prescribed number of particles has been delivered. At CNAO, these operations are performed by the DDS. The main components of this system are 2 independent beam monitoring detectors (BOX1 and BOX2), interfaced with 2 control systems performing real-time control, and connected to the scanning magnets and the beam chopper. As a reaction to any potential hazard, a DDS interlock signal is sent to the Patient Interlock System which immediately stops the irradiation. The tasks and operations performed by the DDS are described following the data flow from the Treatment Planning System through the end of the treatment delivery. The ability of the DDS to guarantee a safe and accurate treatment was validated during the commissioning phase by means of checks of the charge collection efficiency, gain uniformity of the chambers and 2D dose distribution homogeneity and stability. A high level of reliability and robustness has been proven by 3 years of system activity.

  Methods: Dose linearity, mean dose rate, and dose per pulse dependencies of the EDGE Detector were quantified and compared with dosimeters including a W1 scintillator detector, radiochromic film, and ionization chamber that were irradiated with a 10 MeV UHDR beam. The dose, dose rate and dose per pulse were controlled via an in-house developed scintillation-based feedback mechanism, repetition rate of the linear accelerator, and source-to-surface distance, respectively. Depth-dose profiles and temporal profiles at individual pulse resolution were compared to the film and scintillation measurements, respectively. The radiation-induced change in response sensitivity was quantified via irradiation of ~5kGy.
  Results: The EDGE Detector agreed with film measurements in the measured range with varying dose (up to 70 Gy), dose rate (nearly 200 Gy/s), and dose per pulse (up to 0.63 Gy/pulse) on average to within 2%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

The effect of non-ionizing excitations on the diffusion of ion species and inter-track correlations in FLASH ultra-high dose rate radiotherapy,"Ramin Abolfath, Alexander Baikalov, Stefan Bartzsch, Niayesh Afshordi, Radhe Mohan","We present a microscopic mechanism that accounts for the outward burst of ""cold"" ion species (IS) in a high-energy particle track due to coupling with ''hot"" non-ion species (NIS). IS refers to radiolysis products of ionized molecules, whereas NIS refers to non-ionized excitations of molecules in a medium. The interaction is mediated by a quantized field of acoustic phonons, a channel that allows conversion of thermal energy of NIS to kinetic energy of IS, a flow of heat from the outer to the inner core of the track structure. We demonstrate the coexistence of ""hot"" NIS with ""cold"" IS in the radiation track structures right after their generation. NIS, concentrated within nano-scales volumes wrapping around IS, are the main source of intensive heat-waves and the outward burst of IS due to femto-second time scale IS-NIS coupling. By comparing the transport of IS coupled to NIS with identical configurations of non-interacting IS in thermal equilibrium at room temperature, we demonstrate that the energy gain of IS due to the surrounding hot nanoscopic volumes of NIS significantly increases their effective diffusion constants. The much higher diffusion constants predicted in the present model suggest higher inter-track chemical reaction rates at FLASH-UHDR, as well as lower intra-track reaction rates.","Medical Physics, Chaotic Dynamics","19 January, 2022",2201.07887,10.1088/1361-6560/ac69a6,"@misc{2201.07887,

Effective dose fractionation schemes of radiotherapy for prostate cancer,"Jose Alvarez, Kathleen M. Storey, Pavitra Kannan, Heyrim Cho","Radiation therapy has remained as one of the main cancer treatment modalities and a highly cost-effective single modality treatment of cancer care. Typical regimens for fractionated external beam radiotherapy comprise a constant dose administered on weekdays, and no radiation on weekends. However, every patient has a tumor with distinct properties depending on intra-tumor heterogeneity, aggressiveness, and interactive properties with other cells that may make it more resistant or sensitive to radiation treatment. Accordingly, the concept of personalized cancer treatment is emerging to specialize each patient treatment case to the unique properties of the tumor. In this paper, we examine adaptive radiation treatment strategies for heterogeneous tumors using a dynamical system model that consists of radiation-resistant and parental cell populations with unique interactive properties. We study different adaptive dosage strategies for PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. We show that stronger doses of radiation given in longer time intervals, while keeping the overall dosage the same, reduce final tumor volume by more than half in PC3 cell lines, but by only five percent in DU145 cell lines. In addition, we tested an adaptive dosing schedule by administering a stronger dosage on Friday to compensate for the treatment-off period during the weekend, which was effective in decreasing the final tumor volume of both cell lines. This result creates interesting possibilities for new radiotherapy strategies at clinics that cannot provide treatment on weekends. Finally, we propose a dosage plan incorporating our findings.","Medical Physics, Populations and Evolution","25 December, 2021",2112.13188,10.30707/SPORA8.1.1647886301.827288,"@misc{2112.13188,

On methods for radiometric surveying in radiotherapy bunkers,"E. Sergio Santini, Renato Vasconcellos de Oliveira, Nozimar do Couto","Radiometric surveys in radiotherapy bunkers have been carried out in Brazil for many years, both by the same radiotherapy services for verification of shielding as by the regulatory agency for licensing and control purposes. In recent years, the IMRT technique has been gradually incorporated into many services. Therefore, it has been necessary to consider the increased leakage component that has an important impact on the secondary walls. For that, a radiometric survey method has been used that considers an increased ""time of beam - on"" for the secondary walls. In this work we discuss two methods of doing this: the first considers that this ""time of beam - on"" affects the sum of the two components, leakage and scattered. In another method it is considered that only the leakage component is affected by this extended ""time of beam - on "". We compare the methods and show that for secondary walls with $U=1$ the first method overestimates dose rates by important percentages and for secondary walls with $U<1$ it can both overestimate or underestimate the dose rates, depending on the parameters of the project.","Medical Physics, Instrumentation and Detectors","26 July, 2022",2112.1423,,"@misc{2112.14230,

Methods: We tested RTapp (SegAna), a new decision-support software for ART, to investigate 22 HNC patients data retrospectively. For each fraction, RTapp estimated the daily and cumulative doses received by targets and OARs from daily 3D imaging in real-time. RTapp also included a prediction algorithm that analyzed dosimetric parameters (DP) trends against dosimetric endpoints (DE) to trigger adaptation up to 4 fractions ahead. Warning (V95<95%) and adaptation (V95<93%) DEs were set for PTVs. OAR adaptation DEs of +10% (DE10) were set for all Dmax and Dmean DPs. Any DE violation at end of treatment (EOT) triggered a DP trends review to determine the DE-crossing fraction Fx and evaluate the prediction model accuracy (difference between calculated and predicted DP values with 95% confidence intervals). Results: RTapp was able to address the needs of treatment adaptation. 15/22 studies (68%) violated PTV coverage or parotids Dmean at EOT. 9 PTVs had V95<95% (mean coverage decrease of -7.7+/-3.3 %) including 4 flagged for adaptation at median Fx=11.5 (range: 6-18). 15 parotids were flagged for exceeding Dmean constraints with median increase of +3.18 Gy (range: 0.18-6.31 Gy) at EOT, including 8 with DP>DE10.

The most accurate predictions were obtained closest to Fx. For parotids, Fx ranged between fractions 1 to 23, the lack of specific trend demonstrated the need to verify treatment adaptation for every fraction.

A Mathematical Model of Thyroid Disease Response to Radiotherapy,"Araceli Gago-Arias, Sara Neira, Filippo Terragni, Juan Pardo-Montero","We present a mechanistic biomathematical model of molecular radiotherapy of thyroid disease. The general model consists of a set of differential equations describing the dynamics of different populations of thyroid cells with varying degrees of damage caused by radiotherapy (undamaged cells, sub-lethally damaged cells, doomed cells, and dead cells), as well as the dynamics of thyroglobulin and antithyroglobulin autoantibodies, which are important surrogates of treatment response. The model is presented in two flavours: on the one hand, as a deterministic continuous model, which is useful to fit populational data, and on the other hand, as a stochastic Markov model, which is particularly useful to investigate tumor control probabilities and treatment individualization. The model was used to fit the response dynamics (tumor/thyroid volumes, thyroglobulin and antithyroglobulin autoantibodies) observed in experimental studies of thyroid cancer and Graves' disease treated with I-131-radiotherapy. A qualitative adequate fitting of the model to the experimental data was achieved. We also used the model to investigate treatment individualization strategies for differentiated thyroid cancer, aiming to improve the tumor control probability. We found that simple individualization strategies based on the absorbed dose in the tumor and tumor radiosensitivity (which are both magnitudes that can potentially be individually determined for every patient) can lead to an important raise of tumor control probabilities.","Medical Physics, Tissues and Organs","14 October, 2021",2110.07513,10.3390/math9192365,"@misc{2110.07513,

Diamond-based Detection Systems for Accurate Pulsed X-rays Diagnostics in Radiotherapy,"S. Pettinato, M. Girolami, R. Olivieri, A. Stravato, C. Caruso, S. Salvatori","The widespread diffusion of precision radiotherapy techniques, geared toward the release of larger dose gradients in shorter time frames, is leading to new challenges in dosimetry. Accurate dose measurements are essential to check for beam anomalies and inaccuracies to ensure treatment efficacy and patient safety during radiotherapy. This work describes the main features of a diamond dosimeter coupled to an extremely compact front-end electronics. The detection system was tested under the X-ray pulses generated by a medical LINAC for both the 6 MV and the 18 MV accelerating voltages. Located in the LINAC's bunker, it eliminates the need for a long cable connection between the detector and the electronics, detrimental for the system response speed. Signal acquisition was performed synchronously with the impinging X-ray pulses with a sampling period as low as 20 us, allowing for a real-time beam monitoring. The dosimeter demonstrated a very good stability despite the high value of the absorbed dose during the performed experiments (about 100 Gy).

Failure modes and downtime of radiotherapy linear accelerators and Multi-Leaf Collimators in Indonesia,"Gregory S. Peiris, Supriyanto A. Pawiro, Muhammad F. Kasim, Suzanne L. Sheehy","The lack of equitable access to radiotherapy linear accelerators (LINACs) is a substantial barrier to cancer care in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Aside from the issue of cost, there are also issues of robustness of state-of-the-art LINACs in LMICs, which are subject to mechanical and electrical breakdowns, which can result in downtimes ranging from days to months. Recent research has identified disparities in failure frequency and downtimes between LMICs (Nigeria, Botswana) and a High-Income Countries (HIC, the UK), and highlighted the need for additional data and study particularly relating to Multi-Leaf Collimators (MLCs). This study analyses data from 14 Indonesian Hospitals with a total of 19 LINACs and shows the pathways to failure of radiotherapy LINACs and frequency of breakdowns with an additional focus on the Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) subsystem. We found that LINACs throughout Indonesia are out of operation for 7 times longer than HICs and the Mean Time Between Failures of a LINAC in Indonesia is 341.58 Hours, or about 14 days. Furthermore, of the LINACs with an MLC fitted, $59.02^{+1.98}_{-1.61}$% of mechanical faults are due to the MLC and $57.14^{+0.78}_{-1.27}$% of cases requiring a replacement component are related to the MLC. These results outline the need to reassess the current generation of RT LINACs and ultimately work towards guiding future designs to be robust enough for all environments.","Accelerator Physics, Medical Physics","7 November, 2021",2105.08906,,"@misc{2105.08906,

Using constraint structure and an improved object detection network to detect the 12^{th} Vertebra from CT images with a limited field of view for image-guided radiotherapy,"Yunhe Xie, Kongbin Kang, Gregory Sharp, David P. Gierga, Theodore S. Hong, Thomas Bortfeld","Image guidance has been widely used in radiation therapy. Correctly identifying the bounding box of the anatomical landmarks from limited field of views is the key to success. In image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), the detection of those landmarks like the 12th vertebra (T12) still requires tedious manual inspections and annotations; and superior-inferior misalignment to the wrong vertebral body is still relatively common. It is necessary to develop an automated approach to detect those landmarks from images. The challenges of training a model to identify T12 vertebrae automatically mainly are high shape similarity between T12 and neighboring vertebrae, limited annotated data, and class imbalance. This study proposed a novel 3D detection network, requiring only a small amount of training data. Our approach has the following innovations, including 1) the introduction of an auxiliary network to build constraint feature map for improving the model's generalization, especially when the constraint structure is easier to be detected than the main one; 2) an improved detection head and target functions for accurate bounding box detection; and 3) an improved loss functions to address the high class imbalance. Our proposed network was trained, validated and tested on anotated CT images from 55 patients and demonstrated accurate distinguish T12 vertebra from its neighboring vertebrae of high shape similarity. Our proposed algorithm yielded the bounding box center and size errors of 3.98\pm2.04mm and 16.83\pm8.34mm, respectively. Our approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-arts Retina-Net3D in average precision (AP) at IoU thresholds of 0.35 and 0.5, with AP increasing from 0 to 95.4 and 0 to 64.7, respectively.

A rewriting of the relation between the acolinearity of annihilation photons and their energy in the context of positron emission tomography,"Maxime Toussaint, Francis Loignon-Houle, Étienne Auger, Jean-Pierre Dussault, Roger Lecomte","Acolinearity of the annihilation photons observed in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is described as following a Gaussian distribution. However, it is never explicitly said if it refers to the amplitude of the acolinearity angle or its 2D distribution relative to the case without acolinearity (herein defined as the acolinearity deviation). Since the former is obtained by integrating the latter, a wrong interpretation would lead to very different results. The paper of Shibuya et al. (2007), differs from the previous studies since it is based on the precise measurement of the energy of the annihilation photons. They also show that acolinearity follows a Gaussian distribution in the context of PET. However, their notation, which relies on being on the plane where the two annihilation photons travel, could mean that their observation refers to the amplitude of the acolinearity angle. If that understanding is correct, it would mean that acolinearity deviation follows a 2D Gaussian distribution divided by the norm of its argument. Thus, we revisited the proof presented in Shibuya et al.

Enhancing synthetic training data for quantitative photoacoustic tomography with generative deep learning,"Ciaran Bench, Ben T. Cox","Multiwavelength photoacoustic images encode information about a tissue's optical absorption distribution. This can be used to estimate its blood oxygen saturation distribution (sO2), an important physiological indicator of tissue health and pathology. However the wavelength dependence of the light fluence distribution complicates the recovery of accurate estimates, in particular, preventing the use of a straightforward spectroscopic inversion. Deep learning approaches have been shown effective at producing accurate estimates of sO2 from simulated data. Though, the translation of generic supervised learning approaches to real tissues is prevented by the lack of real `paired' training data (multiwavelength PA images of in vivo tissues with their corresponding sO2 distributions). Here, we discuss i) why networks trained on images simulated using conventional means are unlikely to generalise their performance on real tissues, and ii) the prospects of using two generative adversarial network based strategies to improve the generalisability of sO2-estimating networks trained on synthetic data: a) CycleGAN-driven unsupervised domain adaptation of conventionally simulated images, and b) the generation of paired training data using AmbientGANs.",Medical Physics,"8 May, 2023",2305.04714,,"@misc{2305.04714,

Characterization of Electrical Impedance Tomography System,"Vaishali Sharma, Mayank Goswami","Electrical Impedance Tomography can be cost-effective, portable, non-invasive imaging technique. It has preclinical and a few of them already proven industrial applications. This technique can only recover images of low spatial and contrast resolution, partially due to existing physical models. The capability of discriminating between Impedance profiles in recovery is around 73 percentage. However, similar to other modalities, EITs performance depends on the hardware and recovery algorithm design and operating parameters. This work presents an empirically obtained mutual relation between the hardware design related six independent variables, namely (a) molarity of the coupling media, (b) scanning duration, (c) Size of the object, and (d) parameters defining the size of the scanning assembly (No of electrodes, area of the vessel, and percentage periphery covered by the electrodes), affecting its performance.

The root mean square error between the experiment values and predicted values from the presented equation is 1.4053.

Deep-Learning-based Vasculature Extraction for Single-Scan Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography,"Jinpeng Liao, Tianyu Zhang, Yilong Zhang, Chunhui Li, Zhihong Huang","Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that extends the functionality of OCT by extracting moving red blood cell signals from surrounding static biological tissues. OCTA has emerged as a valuable tool for analyzing skin microvasculature, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Most existing OCTA extraction algorithms, such as speckle variance (SV)- and eigen-decomposition (ED)-OCTA, implement a larger number of repeated (NR) OCT scans at the same position to produce high-quality angiography images. However, a higher NR requires a longer data acquisition time, leading to more unpredictable motion artifacts. In this study, we propose a vasculature extraction pipeline that uses only one-repeated OCT scan to generate OCTA images. The pipeline is based on the proposed Vasculature Extraction Transformer (VET), which leverages convolutional projection to better learn the spatial relationships between image patches. In comparison to OCTA images obtained via the SV-OCTA (PSNR: 17.809) and ED-OCTA (PSNR: 18.049) using four-repeated OCT scans, OCTA images extracted by VET exhibit moderate quality (PSNR: 17.515) and higher image contrast while reducing the required data acquisition time from ~8 s to ~2 s. Based on visual observations, the proposed VET outperforms SV and ED algorithms when using neck and face OCTA data in areas that are challenging to scan. This study represents that the VET has the capacity to extract vascularture images from a fast one-repeated OCT scan, facilitating accurate diagnosis for patients.","Image and Video Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Medical Physics","3 May, 2023",2304.08282,,"@misc{2304.08282,

Model-corrected learned primal-dual models for fast limited-view photoacoustic tomography,"Andreas Hauptmann, Jenni Poimala","Learned iterative reconstructions hold great promise to accelerate tomographic imaging with empirical robustness to model perturbations. Nevertheless, an adoption for photoacoustic tomography is hindered by the need to repeatedly evaluate the computational expensive forward model. Computational feasibility can be obtained by the use of fast approximate models, but a need to compensate model errors arises. In this work we advance the methodological and theoretical basis for model corrections in learned image reconstructions by embedding the model correction in a learned primal-dual framework. Here, the model correction is jointly learned in data space coupled with a learned updating operator in image space within an unrolled end-to-end learned iterative reconstruction approach. The proposed formulation allows an extension to a primal-dual deep equilibrium model providing fixed-point convergence as well as reduced memory requirements for training. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the proposed models with numerical validation in a realistic 2D limited-view setting.

Multi-focus averaging for multiple scattering suppression in optical coherence tomography,"Lida Zhu, Shuichi Makita, Junya Tamaoki, Antonia Lichtenegger, Yiheng Lim, Yiqiang Zhu, Makoto Kobayashiand Yoshiaki Yasuno","Multiple scattering is one of the main factors that limits the penetration depth of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in scattering samples. We propose a method termed multi-focus averaging (MFA) to suppress the multiple-scattering signals and improve the image contrast of OCT in deep regions. The MFA method captures multiple OCT volumes with various focal positions and averages them in complex form after correcting the varying defocus through computational refocusing. Because the multiple-scattering takes different trajectories among the different focal position configurations, this averaging suppresses the multiple-scattering signal. Meanwhile, the single-scattering takes a consistent trajectory regardless of the focal position configuration and is not suppressed. Hence, the MFA method improves the signal ratio between the single- and multiple-scattering signals and improves the image contrast. A scattering phantom and a postmortem zebrafish were measured for validation of the proposed method. The results showed that the contrast of intensity images of both the phantom and zebrafish were improved using the MFA method, such that they were better than the contrast provided by the standard complex averaging method. The MFA method provides a cost-effective solution for contrast enhancement through multiple-scattering reduction in tissue imaging using OCT systems.","Optics, Biological Physics, Instrumentation and Detectors, Medical Physics","21 April, 2023",2304.11309,,"@misc{2304.11309,

Improving Automated Hemorrhage Detection in Sparse-view Computed Tomography via Deep Convolutional Neural Network based Artifact Reduction,"Johannes Thalhammer, Manuel Schultheiss, Tina Dorosti, Tobias Lasser, Franz Pfeiffer, Daniela Pfeiffer, Florian Schaff","Intracranial hemorrhage poses a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment. For diagnosis, a Cranial Computed Tomography (CCT) scan is usually performed. However, the increased health risk caused by radiation is a concern. The most important strategy to reduce this potential risk is to keep the radiation dose as low as possible and consistent with the diagnostic task. Sparse-view CT can be an effective strategy to reduce dose by reducing the total number of views acquired, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we use a U-Net architecture to reduce artifacts from sparse-view CCTs, predicting fully sampled reconstructions from sparse-view ones. We evaluate the hemorrhage detectability in the predicted CCTs with a hemorrhage classification convolutional neural network, trained on fully sampled CCTs to detect and classify different sub-types of hemorrhages. Our results suggest that the automated classification and detection accuracy of hemorrhages in sparse-view CCTs can be improved substantially by the U-Net. This demonstrates the feasibility of rapid automated hemorrhage detection on low-dose CT data to assist radiologists in routine clinical practice.","Image and Video Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Medical Physics","16 March, 2023",2303.0934,,"@misc{2303.09340,

Novel manufacturing techniques were used, resulting in a 1.17$^{\circ}$ mean beam axis skew angle, a 104 $μ$m mean element position error, and a $\pm$13.6 $μ$m deviation in matching layer thickness. The nominal acoustic performance was measured using hydrophone scans and watershot data, and the 61.2 dB SNR, 55.4$^{\circ}$ opening angle, 16.3 mm beamwidth and 54% transmit-receive bandwidth (-12 dB), were found to be similar to existing systems, and compatible with full waveform inversion reconstruction methods. The inter-element variation in acoustic performance was typically <10% without using normalisation, meaning that the elements can be modelled identically during image reconstruction, removing the need for individual source definitions based on hydrophone measurements. Finally, data from a phantom experiment was successfully reconstructed. These results demonstrate that the open-UST system is accessible for users, and suitable for UST imaging research.",Medical Physics,"20 February, 2023",2302.10114,,"@misc{2302.10114,

Improving the Timing Resolution of Positron Emission Tomography Detectors using Boosted Learning -- A Residual Physics Approach,"Stephan Naunheim, Yannick Kuhl, David Schug, Volkmar Schulz, Florian Mueller","Artificial intelligence is finding its way into medical imaging, usually focusing on image reconstruction or enhancing analytical reconstructed images. However, optimizations along the complete processing chain, from detecting signals to computing data, enable significant improvements. Thus, we present an approach toward detector optimization using boosted learning by exploiting the concept of residual physics. In our work, we improve the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of positron emission tomography (PET) detectors. PET enables imaging of metabolic processes by detecting γ-photons with scintillation detectors. Current research exploits light-sharing detectors, where the scintillation light is distributed over and digitized by an array of readout channels. While these detectors demonstrate excellent performance parameters, e.g., regarding spatial resolution, extracting precise timing information for time-of-flight (TOF) becomes more challenging due to deteriorating effects called time skews. Conventional correction methods mainly rely on analytical formulations, theoretically capable of covering all time skew effects, e.g., caused by signal runtimes or physical effects. However, additional effects are involved for light-sharing detectors, so finding suitable analytical formulations can become arbitrarily complicated. The residual physics-based strategy uses gradient tree boosting (GTB) and a physics-informed data generation mimicking an actual imaging process by shifting a radiation source. We used clinically relevant detectors with a height of 19 mm, coupled to digital photosensor arrays. All trained models improved the CTR significantly. Using the best model, we achieved CTRs down to 198 ps (185 ps) for energies ranging from 300 keV to 700 keV (450 keV to 550 keV).","Machine Learning, Instrumentation and Detectors, Medical Physics","3 February, 2023",2302.01681,,"@misc{2302.01681,

A forward model incorporating elevation-focused transducer properties for 3D full-waveform inversion in ultrasound computed tomography,"Fu Li, Umberto Villa, Nebojsa Duric, Mark A. Anastasio","Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that holds great promise for improving human health. Full-waveform inversion (FWI)-based image reconstruction methods account for the relevant wave physics to produce high spatial resolution images of the acoustic properties of the breast tissues. A practical USCT design employs a circular ring-array comprised of elevation-focused ultrasonic transducers, and volumentric imaging is achieved by translating the ring-array orthogonally to the imaging plane. In commonly deployed slice-by-slice (SBS) reconstruction approaches, the three-dimensional (3D) volume is reconstructed by stacking together two-dimensional (2D) images reconstructed for each position of the ring-array. A limitation of the SBS reconstruction approach is that it does not account for 3D wave propagation physics and the focusing properties of the transducers, which can result in significant image artifacts and inaccuracies. To perform 3D image reconstruction when elevation-focused transducers are employed, a numerical description of the focusing properties of the transducers should be included in the forward model. To address this, a 3D computational model of an elevation-focused transducer is developed to enable 3D FWI-based reconstruction methods to be deployed in ring-array-based USCT. The focusing is achieved by applying a spatially varying temporal delay to the ultrasound pulse (emitter mode) and recorded signal (receiver mode). The proposed numerical transducer model is quantitatively validated and employed in computer-simulation studies that demonstrate its use in image reconstruction for ring-array USCT",Medical Physics,"18 January, 2023",2301.07787,,"@misc{2301.07787,

Machine Learning-based Signal Quality Assessment for Cardiac Volume Monitoring in Electrical Impedance Tomography,"Chang Min Hyun, Tae Jun Jang, Jeongchan Nam, Hyeuknam Kwon, Kiwan Jeon, Kyunghun Lee","Owing to recent advances in thoracic electrical impedance tomography, a patient's hemodynamic function can be noninvasively and continuously estimated in real-time by surveilling a cardiac volume signal associated with stroke volume and cardiac output. In clinical applications, however, a cardiac volume signal is often of low quality, mainly because of the patient's deliberate movements or inevitable motions during clinical interventions. This study aims to develop a signal quality indexing method that assesses the influence of motion artifacts on transient cardiac volume signals. The assessment is performed on each cardiac cycle to take advantage of the periodicity and regularity in cardiac volume changes. Time intervals are identified using the synchronized electrocardiography system. We apply divergent machine-learning methods, which can be sorted into discriminative-model and manifold-learning approaches. The use of machine-learning could be suitable for our real-time monitoring application that requires fast inference and automation as well as high accuracy. In the clinical environment, the proposed method can be utilized to provide immediate warnings so that clinicians can minimize confusion regarding patients' conditions, reduce clinical resource utilization, and improve the confidence level of the monitoring system. Numerous experiments using actual EIT data validate the capability of cardiac volume signals degraded by motion artifacts to be accurately and automatically assessed in real-time by machine learning.

Possible depth-resolved reconstruction of shear moduli in the cornea following collagen crosslinking (CXL) with optical coherence tomography and elastography,"Gabriel Regnault, Mitchell A.

Here we propose to combine phase-decorrelation measurement applied to OCT structural images and acoustic micro-tapping (A$μ$T) OCE to explore possible depth reconstruction of stiffness within crosslinked corneas in an ex vivo human cornea sample. The analysis of experimental OCT images is used to define the penetration depth of CXL into the cornea, which varies from $\sim$100$μm$ in the periphery to $\sim$150$μm$ in the central area and exhibits a sharp transition between areas. This information was used in a two-layer analytical model to quantify the stiffness of the treated layer.

Normalized Blood Flow Index in Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Provides a Sensitive Biomarker of Early Diabetic Retinopathy,"Albert K. Dadzie, David Le, Mansour Abtahi, Behrouz Ebrahimi, Taeyoon Son, Jennifer I. Lim, Xincheng Yao","Purpose: To evaluate the sensitivity of normalized blood flow index (NBFI) for detecting early diabetic retinopathy (DR).

The OCTA images were centered on the fovea and covered a 6 mm x 6 mm area. Enface projections of the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP) were obtained for the quantitative OCTA feature analysis. Three quantitative OCTA features were examined: blood vessel density (BVD), blood flow flux (BFF), and normalized blood flow index (NBFI). Each feature was calculated from both the SVP and DCP and their sensitivity to distinguish the three cohorts of the study were evaluated. Results: The only quantitative feature that was capable of distinguishing between all three cohorts was NBFI in the DCP image. Comparative study revealed that both BVD and BFF were able to distinguish the controls from NoDR and mild NPDR. However, neither BVD nor BFF was sensitive enough to separate NoDR from the healthy controls. Conclusion: The NBFI has been demonstrated as a sensitive biomarker of early DR, revealing retinal blood flow abnormality better than traditional BVD and BFF. The NBFI in the DCP was verified as the most sensitive biomarker, supporting that diabetes affects the DCP earlier than SVP in DR.","Medical Physics, Image and Video Processing, Biological Physics","22 December, 2022",2212.1484,,"@misc{2212.14840,

Proton Computed Tomography Based on Richardson-Lucy Algorithm,"Ákos Sudár, Gergely Gábor Barnaföldi","Objective: Proton therapy is a emerging method against cancer. One of the main development is to increase the accuracy of the Bragg-peak position calculation, which requires more precise relative stopping power (RSP) measurements. An excellent choice is the application of proton computed tomography (pCT) systems which take the images under similar conditions to treatment as they use the same irradiation device and hadron beam for imaging and treatment. A key aim is to develop an accurate image reconstruction algorithm for pCT systems to reach their maximal performance.
  Approach: An image reconstruction algorithm was developed in this work, which is suitable to reconstruct pCT images from the energy, position and direction measurement of individual protons. The flexibility of an iterative image reconstruction algorithm was utilised to appropriately model the trajectory of protons. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of a Derenzo and a CTP404 phantom was used to test the accuracy of the image reconstruction.
  Main results: The Richardson-Lucy algorithm was applied first and successfully for pCT image reconstruction. Probability density based approach was applied for interaction (system) matrix generation, which is an advanced approach to consider the uncertain path of the protons in the patient.
  Significance: The track of protons are scattered when they travel through material at the hadron therapy energies. This property limits the achievable spatial resolution, especially for single-sided pCT setups investigated in this study. The main motivation of the presented research is to test new approaches for the image reconstruction, focusing on the achieved spatial- and density resolution and the image noise. Realistic imaging setup were simulated with reasonably low proton statistics, to achieve results, which is likely to be reproducible in clinical environment.","Medical Physics, Instrumentation and Detectors","30 November, 2022",2212.00126,,"@misc{2212.00126,

An Edge Alignment-based Orientation Selection Method for Neutron Tomography,"Diyu Yang, Shimin Tang, Singanallur V. Venkatakrishnan, Mohammad S. N. Chowdhury, Yuxuan Zhang, Hassina Z. Bilheux, Gregery T. Buzzard, Charles A.

A typical workflow involves placing the sample in the path of a neutron beam, acquiring projection data at a predefined set of orientations, and processing the resulting data using an analytic reconstruction algorithm. Typical nCT scans require hours to days to complete and are then processed using conventional filtered back-projection (FBP), which performs poorly with sparse views or noisy data. Hence, the main methods in order to reduce overall acquisition time are the use of an improved sampling strategy combined with the use of advanced reconstruction methods such as model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). In this paper, we propose an adaptive orientation selection method in which an MBIR reconstruction on previously-acquired measurements is used to define an objective function on orientations that balances a data-fitting term promoting edge alignment and a regularization term promoting orientation diversity. Using simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate that our method produces high-quality reconstructions using significantly fewer total measurements than the conventional approach.","Image and Video Processing, Medical Physics","8 March, 2023",2212.00647,,"@misc{2212.00647,

There is a good agreement in the findings for RPE abnormalities: recall was 0.869 and precision was 0.920 for 20 cases with retinal diseases. In five cases of healthy volunteers, no abnormalities were found in either the synthesized or ground truth DOPU images.

For both spheroid types, structural corruptions and reduction of LIV and OCDSl were observed. These results may indicate different mechanisms of the drug action. The results suggest that dynamic OCT can be used to highlight drug response patterns and perform anti-cancer drug testing.","Medical Physics, Biological Physics, Optics","11 November, 2022",2211.06148,,"@misc{2211.06148,

"Multi-contrast Jones-matrix optical coherence tomography -- the concept, principle, implementation, and applications",Yoshiaki Yasuno,"Jones-matrix optical coherence tomography (JM-OCT) is an extension of OCT that provides multiple types of optical contrasts of biological and clinical samples. JM-OCT measures the spatial distribution of the Jones matrix of the sample and also its time sequence. All contrasts (i.e., multi-contrast OCT images) are then computed from the Jones matrix. The contrasts obtained from the Jones matrix include the conventional and polarization-insensitive OCT intensity, cumulative and local phase retardation (birefringence), degree-of-polarization uniformity quantifying the polarization randomness of the sample, signal attenuation coefficient, sample scatterer density, Doppler OCT, OCT angiography, and dynamic OCT. JM-OCT is a generalized version of OCT because it measures the generalized form of the sample information; i.e., the Jones matrix sequence. This review summarizes the basic conception, mathematical principle, hardware implementation, signal and image processing, and biological and clinical applications of JM-OCT. Advanced technical topics, including JM-OCT-specific noise correction and quantity estimation and JM-OCT's self-calibration nature, are also described.","Medical Physics, Applied Physics, Instrumentation and Detectors, Optics","23 March, 2023",2211.17151,10.1109/JSTQE.2023.3248148,"@misc{2211.17151,

Critique of optical coherence tomography in epistemological metrology,Yoshiaki Yasuno,"This treaties aims to introduce a speculative framework to comprehend modern metrology. In a classical sense, measurement measures physically existing quantities, such as length, mass, and time. By contrast, modern measurement measures a wide spectrum of objects, for example, an imaging biomarker, which is a user-defined pattern. Artificial-intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis is another example. If we regard an optical coherence tomography (OCT) device equipped with diagnostic AI as a comprehensive ""measurement system,"" the object being measured is a ""disease,"" which is not a physical quantity but a concept.
  To comprehend the wide range of modern measurements, we introduce a speculative, i.e., philosophical and theoretical, model called the ""epistemological-metrology model."" In this model, we describe the act of measurement as cascading encoding-and-decoding processes. In the encoding processes, three types of objects-to-be measured are considered, which include substance, existence, and concept. Then we classify acts of measurement into ""sensing,"" ""understanding,"" and ""reasoning,"" which measure the substance, existence, and concept, respectively.
  We note that the measurements in the understanding and reasoning classes are constructive. Namely, they proactively define the quantity-to-be-measured by the measurement modalities themselves. A speculative method to warrant the relevance of such constructive measurements is presented.
  We investigate several modern OCT-related measurements, including AI-based diagnosis, types of polarization sensitive OCT, and attenuation coefficient imaging, using our theoretical framework.","Medical Physics, History and Philosophy of Physics","18 April, 2023",2211.05707,,"@misc{2211.05707,

Dose measurements with a prototype of an active personal eye lens dosemeter based on the Dosepix detector are presented.

The energy dependence of the normalized response is investigated for mean photon energies between $12.4\,$keV and $248\,$keV for continuous reference radiation fields (N-series) according to ISO 4037. The response normalized to N-60 ($\overline{E}=47.9\,\text{keV}$) at $0^\circ$ angle of irradiation stays within the approval limits of IEC 61526 for angles of incidence between $-75^\circ$ and $+75^\circ$.

The dose measurement works well within the approval limits (acc. to IEC 61526) up to $1\,\frac{\text{Sv}}{\text{h}}$. No significant influence of the pulse duration on the measured dose is found.

Phantom study for 90Y post-treatment dosimetry with a long axial field-of-view PET/CT,"Lorenzo Mercolli, Konstantinos Zeimpekis, George A. Prenosil, Hendrik G. Rathke, Axel Rominger, Kuangyu Shi","Purpose: The physical properties of yttrium-90 (90Y) allow for imaging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The increased sensitivity of long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners possibly allows to overcome the small branching ratio for positron production from 90Y decays and to improve for the post-treatment dosimetry of 90Y of selective internal radiation therapy.
  Methods: For the challenging case of an image quality body phantom, we compare a full Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation with the results from the two commercial software packages Simplicit90Y and Hermes. The voxel dosimetry module of Hermes relies on the 90Y images taken with a LAFOV PET/CT, while the MC and Simplicit90Y dose calculations are image independent.
  Results: The resulting doses from the MC calculation and Simplicit90Y agree well within the error margins. The image-based dose calculation with Hermes, however, consistently underestimates the dose. This is due to the mismatch of the activity distribution in the PET images and the size of the volume of interest. Furthermore, there are likely limitations of Hermes' dose calculation algorithm for 90Y. We found that only for the smallest phantom sphere there is a statistically significant dependence of the Hermes dose on the image reconstruction parameters and scan time.
  Conclusion: Our study shows that Simplicit90Y's local deposition model can provide a reliable dose estimate. On the other hand, the image based dose calculation requires further benchmarks and verification in order to take full advantage of LAFOV PET/CT systems.",Medical Physics,"28 April, 2023",2304.14797,,"@misc{2304.14797,

F-PSMA-1007 salivary gland dosimetry : Comparison between different methods for dose calculation and assessment of inter- and intra-patient variability,"Daniele Pistone, Silvano Gnesin, Lucrezia Auditore, Antonio Italiano, Giuseppe Lucio Cascini, Ernesto Amato, Francesco Cicone","Dosimetry of salivary glands (SGs) is usually implemented using simplified calculation approaches and approximated geometries. Our aims were to compare different dosimetry methods to calculate SGs absorbed doses (ADs) following 18F-PSMA-1007 injection, and to assess the AD variation across patients and single SG components. Five patients with prostate cancer recurrence underwent PET/CT acquisitions of the head and neck, 0.5, 2 and 4 hours after 18F-PSMA-1007 injection. Parotid and submandibular glands were segmented on CT to derive SGs volumes and masses, while PETs were used to derive Time-Integrated Activity Coefficients. Average ADs to single SG components or total SG (tSG) were calculated with the following methods: i) direct Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with GATE/GEANT4; ii) spherical model (SM) of OLINDA/EXM 2.1, adopting either patient-specific or standard ICRP89 organ masses (SMstd); iii) ellipsoidal model (EM); iv) MIRD approach with organ S-factors from OLINDA/EXM 2.1 and OpenDose collaboration, with or without contribution from cross irradiation originating outside the SGs. The maximum percent AD difference across SG components (δmax) and across patients (Δmax) were calculated. Compared to MC, ADs to single SG components were significantly underestimated by all methods (average relative differences between -14.5% and -30.4%). Using MC, SM and EM, δmax were never below 25% (up to 113%). δmax up to 702% were obtained with SMstd. Concerning tSG, results within 10% of the MC were obtained only if cross irradiation from the remainder of the body or from the remainder of the head was accounted for. The Δmax ranged between 58% and 78% across patients.

  Methods: We determined a relationship between dose and optical density (OD) of EBT-XD Gafchromic film using scanned 10x10 cm2 proton pencil beams delivered at clinical dose rates; the dose was measured with an Advanced Markus chamber. On a small animal proton irradiation platform, double-scattered pencil beams with 5 or 8 mm diameter brass collimation at conventional and ultra-high dose rates were delivered to the EBT-XD films. The proton fluence charges were collected by a Faraday cup placed downstream from the film. The average of the irradiated film ODs was related to the Faraday cup charges. A conversion from the Faraday cup charge to the average dose of the small-field proton beam was then obtained.
  Results: The relationship between the small-field average profile dose and Faraday cup charge was established for 10 and 15 Gy mice FLASH experiments. The film OD was found to be independent of dose rate. At small-animal treatments, the Faraday cup readings were conveniently used to QA and monitor the delivered dose and dose rates to the mice under conventional and ultra-high dose rates.
  Conclusion: The dose calibration and monitoring method with Faraday cup for small animal proton FLASH experiments is time-efficient and cost-effective and can be used for irradiations of various small field sizes.

  Methods: 3D printing techniques were used to create the anthropomorphic phantom from a patient CT dataset. Three Iodine-131 SPECT/CT imaging studies were performed using a homogeneous, Jaszczak, and an anthropomorphic phantom to quantify the SPECT images. The impact of collimator detector response (CDR) modeling and volume-based partial volume corrections (PVC) upon the absorbed dose was calculated using an image based, Geant4 Monte Carlo RPT dosimetry workflow and compared against a ground truth scenario. Finally, uncertainties were quantified in accordance with recent EANM guidelines.
  Results: The 3D printed anthropomorphic phantom was an accurate re-creation of patient anatomy including bone. The extrapolated Jaszczak recovery coefficients were greater than that of the 3D printed insert (~22.8 ml) for both the CDR and non-CDR cases. Utilizing Jaszczak phantom PVCs, the absorbed dose was underpredicted by 0.7% and 4.9% without and with CDR, respectively. Utilizing anthropomorphic phantom RCs overpredicted the absorbed dose by 3% both with and without CDR. All dosimetry scenarios that incorporated PVC were within the calculated uncertainty of the activity. The uncertainties in the cumulative activity ranged from 25.6% to 113% for Jaszczak spheres ranging in volume from 0.5 ml to 16 ml.

Quantification of internal dosimetry in PET patients II: Individualized Monte Carlo-based dosimetry for [18F]Fluorocholine PET,"Sara Neira, Jacobo Guiu-Souto, Paulino Pais, Sofía Rodríguez Martínez de Llano, Carlos Fernández, Virginia Pubul, Álvaro Ruibal, Miguel Pombar, Araceli Gago-Arias, Juan Pardo-Montero","Purpose: To obtain individualized internal doses with a Monte Carlo method in patients undergoing diagnostic FCH-PET studies and to compare such doses with the MIRD method calculations. Methods: A patient cohort of 17 males were imaged after intravenous administration of a mean FCH activity of 244.3 MBq. The resulting PET/CT images were processed in order to generate individualized input source and geometry files for dose computation with the MC tool GATE. The resulting dose estimates were studied and compared to the MIRD method with two different computational phantoms. Mass correction of the S-factors was applied when possible. Potential sources of uncertainty were closely examined: the effect of partial body images, urinary bladder emptying, and biokinetic modeling.
  Results: Large differences in doses between our methodology and the MIRD method were found, generally in the range of $\pm$25%, and up to $\pm$120% for some cases. The mass scaling showed improvements, especially for non-walled and high-uptake tissues. Simulations of the urinary bladder emptying showed negligible effects on doses to other organs, with the exception of the prostate. Dosimetry based on partial PET/CT images (excluding the legs) resulted in an over-estimation of mean doses to bone, skin, and remaining tissues, and minor differences in other organs/tissues. Estimated uncertainties associated with the biokinetics of FCH introduce variations of cumulated activities in the range of $\pm$10% in the high-uptake organs.
  Conclusions: The MC methodology allows for a higher degree of dosimetry individualization than the MIRD methodology, which in some cases leads to important differences in dose values. Dosimetry of FCH-PET based on a single partial PET study seems viable due to the particular biokinetics of FCH, even though some correction factors may need to be applied to estimate mean skin/bone doses.",Medical Physics,"25 January, 2022",2201.10601,10.1002/mp.15090,"@misc{2201.10601,

Gross patient error detection via cine transmission dosimetry,"Nguyen Phuong Dang, Victor Gabriel Leandro Alves, Mahmoud Ahmed, Jeffrey Siebers","$\textbf{Purpose:}$ To quantify the effectiveness of EPID-based cine transmission dosimetry to detect gross patient anatomic errors. $\textbf{Method and Materials:}$ EPID image frames resulting from fluence transmitted through multiple patients anatomies are simulated for 100 msec delivery intervals for hypothetical 6 MV VMAT deliveries. Frames simulated through 10 head-and-neck CTs and 19 prostate CTs with and without 1-3 mm shift and 1-3 degree rotations were used to quantify expected in-tolerance clinical setup variations. Per-frame analysis methods to determine if simulated gross errors of (a) 10-20 mm patient miss alignment offsets and (b) 15-20 degree patient rotations could be reliably distinguished from the above baseline variations. For the prostate image sets, frames simulated through the reference CT are intercompared with (c) frames through 8-13 different CT's for the same patient to quantify expected inter-treatment frame variation. ROC analysis of per-frame error discrimination based upon (i) frame image differences, (ii) frame histogram comparisons, (iii) image feature matching, and (iv) image distance were used to quantify error detectability. $\textbf{Results:}$ Each error detection method was able to distinguish gross patient miss-alignment and gross rotations from in-tolerance levels for both H&N and prostate datasets.

Electron backscattering for signal enhancement in a thin-film CdTe radiation detector,"Fatemeh Akbari, Diana Shvydka","We investigated the possibility of augmenting the fluence of electrons traversing CdTe thin film and thus increasing the detected signal pursuing two venues: adding a high-Z metal layer to the back of the detector surface, and adding a top low-Z material to the detector layer to return its backscattered electrons. Copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) layers of varying thickness were investigated as potential metal back-reflectors, while PMMA was tried as the top cover in multilayer detector structures. The Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport package MCNP5 was first used to model a basic multilayer structure under a Varian 6MV. It was then modified by the addition of Cu and Pb to analyze the extent of the signal enhancement and changes in secondary electron fluence spectra. Backscattering coefficients were then calculated using EGSnrc for electron sources. Analytical functions were established to represent the best-fitting curves to the simulation data. Finally, electron backscattering data were related to signal enhancement. It was found that adding a metal film below the sensitive volume of a detector increases the fraction of reflected electrons, especially in the low energy range, resulting in ~10% and 75% increased energy deposition using Cu and Pb, respectively. We also established a linear dependence between the energy deposition in the semiconductor layer and the fluence of backscattered electrons in the corresponding multilayer structure. The low-Z top layer in practically implemental thicknesses of tens of microns has a positive effect due to partial electron reflection back to the semiconductor layer. Signal enhancement in a thin-film CdTe radiation detector could be achieved using electron backscattering from metal reflectors. The methodology explored here warrants further studies to quantify achievable signal enhancement for various thin-film and other small sensitive volume detectors.","Medical Physics, Applied Physics","5 January, 2022",2201.01707,10.1002/mp.15813,"@misc{2201.01707,

Distributed and Scalable Optimization for Robust Proton Treatment Planning,"Anqi Fu, Vicki T. Taasti, Masoud Zarepisheh","Purpose: The importance of robust proton treatment planning to mitigate the impact of uncertainty is well understood. However, its computational cost grows with the number of uncertainty scenarios, prolonging the treatment planning process. We developed a fast and scalable distributed optimization platform that parallelizes this computation over the scenarios. Methods: We modeled the robust proton treatment planning problem as a weighted least-squares problem. To solve it, we employed an optimization technique called the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers with Barzilai-Borwein step size (ADMM-BB). We reformulated the problem in such a way as to split the main problem into smaller subproblems, one for each proton therapy uncertainty scenario. The subproblems can be solved in parallel, allowing the computational load to be distributed across multiple processors (e.g., CPU threads/cores). We evaluated ADMM-BB on four head-and-neck proton therapy patients, each with 13 scenarios accounting for 3 mm setup and 3:5% range uncertainties. We then compared the performance of ADMM-BB with projected gradient descent (PGD) applied to the same problem. Results: For each patient, ADMM-BB generated a robust proton treatment plan that satisfied all clinical criteria with comparable or better dosimetric quality than the plan generated by PGD. However, ADMM-BB's total runtime averaged about 6 to 7 times faster. This speedup increased with the number of scenarios. Conclusion: ADMM-BB is a powerful distributed optimization method that leverages parallel processing platforms, such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cloud servers, to accelerate the computationally intensive work of robust proton treatment planning. This results in 1) a shorter treatment planning process and 2) the ability to consider more uncertainty scenarios, which improves plan quality.","Medical Physics, Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing, Optimization and Control","27 April, 2023",2304.14568,10.1002/mp.15897,"@misc{2304.14568,

For this purpose, a concept of macro peak doses and macro valley doses is introduced, describing the respective doses not on a microscopic level but as macroscopic quantities in larger voxels. The ML model is trained to mimic full Monte Carlo (MC) data. Complex physical effects such as polarization are therefore automatically taking into account by the model.

We describe a new framework for optimization of filter design and spot maps to meet the unique demands of FLASH radiotherapy. We demonstrate an Integrated Biological Optimization IMPT (IBO-IMPT) approach for optimization of dose, dose-averaged dose rate (DADR), and dose-averaged LET (LETd). Methods: We developed inverse planning software to design patient-specific ridge filters that spread the Bragg peak from a fixed-energy, 250 MeV beam to a proximal beam-specific planning target volume. The software optimizes patient-specific ridge filter and uses a Monte Carlo calculation engine, based on Geant4, to provide dose and LET influence matrices. Plan optimization, using matRAD, accommodates the IBO-IMPT objective function considering dose, dose rate, and LET simultaneously with minimum MU constraints. The framework enables design of both regularly spaced and sparse-optimized ridge filters, which allow faster delivery and selective LET optimization. Volume distributions and histograms for dose, DADR, and LETd are compared using evaluation structures specific to the heart and lung. Results: We used IBO-IMPT to design ridge filters for a central lung tumor patient. The IBO-IMPT framework selectively spared heart and lung by reducing LET and increasing dose rate, relative to IMPT planning. Sparse-optimized ridge filters were superior to regularly spaced ridge filters in dose rate.

We designed an algorithm to automate the clinical workflow for planning with field-in-field. DL models were trained, validated, and tested on 555 patients to automatically generate aperture shapes for primary and boost fields. Network inputs were digitally reconstructed radiography, gross tumor volume(GTV), and nodal GTV. A physician scored each aperture for 20 patients on a 5-point scale(>3 acceptable). A planning algorithm was then developed to create a homogeneous dose using a combination of wedges and subfields. The algorithm iteratively identifies a hotspot volume, creates a subfield, and optimizes beam weight all without user intervention. The algorithm was tested on 20 patients using clinical apertures with different settings, and the resulting plans(4 plans/patient) were scored by a physician. The end-to-end workflow was tested and scored by a physician on 39 patients using DL-generated apertures and planning algorithms. The predicted apertures had Dice scores of 0.95, 0.94, and 0.90 for posterior-anterior, laterals, and boost fields, respectively. 100%, 95%, and 87.5% of the posterior-anterior, laterals, and boost apertures were scored as clinically acceptable, respectively. Wedged and non-wedged plans were clinically acceptable for 85% and 50% of patients, respectively. The final plans hotspot dose percentage was reduced from 121%($\pm$ 14%) to 109%($\pm$ 5%) of prescription dose.

Domain Adaptation of Automated Treatment Planning from Computed Tomography to Magnetic Resonance,"Aly Khalifa, Jeff Winter, Inmaculada Navarro, Chris McIntosh, Thomas G. Purdie","Objective: Machine learning (ML) based radiation treatment (RT) planning addresses the iterative and time-consuming nature of conventional inverse planning. Given the rising importance of Magnetic resonance (MR) only treatment planning workflows, we sought to determine if an ML based treatment planning model, trained on computed tomography (CT) imaging, could be applied to MR through domain adaptation. Methods: In this study, MR and CT imaging was collected from 55 prostate cancer patients treated on an MR linear accelerator. ML based plans were generated for each patient on both CT and MR imaging using a commercially available model in RayStation 8B. The dose distributions and acceptance rates of MR and CT based plans were compared using institutional dose-volume evaluation criteria. The dosimetric differences between MR and CT plans were further decomposed into setup, cohort, and imaging domain components. Results: MR plans were highly acceptable, meeting 93.1% of all evaluation criteria compared to 96.3% of CT plans, with dose equivalence for all evaluation criteria except for the bladder wall, penile bulb, small and large bowel, and one rectum wall criteria (p<0.05). Changing the input imaging modality (domain component) only accounted for about half of the dosimetric differences observed between MR and CT plans. Anatomical differences between the ML training set and the MR linac cohort (cohort component) were also a significant contributor. Significance: We were able to create highly acceptable MR based treatment plans using a CT-trained ML model for treatment planning, although clinically significant dose deviations from the CT based plans were observed.","Medical Physics, Machine Learning","7 March, 2022",2203.03576,10.1088/1361-6560/ac72ec,"@misc{2203.03576,

Bi-objective optimization of organ properties for the simulation of intracavitary brachytherapy applicator placement in cervical cancer,"Cedric J. Rodriguez, Stephanie M. de Boer, Peter A. N. Bosman, Tanja Alderliesten","Validation of deformable image registration techniques is extremely important, but hard, especially when complex deformations or content mismatch are involved. These complex deformations and content mismatch, for example, occur after the placement of an applicator for brachytherapy for cervical cancer. Virtual phantoms could enable the creation of validation data sets with ground truth deformations that simulate the large deformations that occur between image acquisitions. However, the quality of the multi-organ Finite Element Method (FEM)-based simulations is dependent on the patient-specific external forces and mechanical properties assigned to the organs. A common approach to calibrate these simulation parameters is through optimization, finding the parameter settings that optimize the match between the outcome of the simulation and reality. When considering inherently simplified organ models, we hypothesize that the optimal deformations of one organ cannot be achieved with a single parameter setting without compromising the optimality of the deformation of the surrounding organs. This means that there will be a trade-off between the optimal deformations of adjacent organs, such as the vagina-uterus and bladder. This work therefore proposes and evaluates a multi-objective optimization approach where the trade-off between organ deformations can be assessed after optimization. We showcase what the extent of the trade-off looks like when bi-objectively optimizing the patient-specific mechanical properties and external forces of the vagina-uterus and bladder for FEM-based simulations.",Medical Physics,"22 February, 2023",2303.08124,,"@misc{2303.08124,

A comprehensive dataset of TG-43 parameters is compiled, including detailed source descriptions, dose-rate constants, radial dose functions, 1D and 2D anisotropy functions, along-away dose-rate tables, Primary and Scatter Separated (PSS) dose tables, and mean photon energies escaping each source. The database also documents the source models which will be freely distributed with egs_brachy. ACQUISITION AND VALIDATION METHODS: Datasets are calculated after a recoding of the source geometries using the egs++ geometry package and its egs_brachy extensions. Air kerma per history is calculated in a 10x10x0.05 cm3 voxel located 100 cm from the source along the transverse axis and then corrected for the lateral and thickness dimensions of the scoring voxel to give the air kerma on the central axis at a point 100cm from the source's mid-point. Full-scatter water phantoms with varying voxel resolutions in cylindrical coordinates are used for dose calculations. For validation, data are compared to those from CLRP_TG43v1 and published data.

Especially in areas, related to medical imaging it plays a big role. However, in interventional radiotherapy (brachytherapy) deep learning is still in an early phase. In this review, first, we investigated and scrutinised the role of deep learning in all processes of interventional radiotherapy and directly related fields. Additionally we summarised the most recent developments. To reproduce results of deep learning algorithms both source code and training data must be available. Therefore, a second focus of this work was on the analysis of the availability of open source, open data and open models. In our analysis, we were able to show that deep learning plays already a major role in some areas of interventional radiotherapy, but is still hardly presented in others. Nevertheless, its impact is increasing with the years, partly self-propelled but also influenced by closely related fields. Open source, data and models are growing in number but are still scarce and unevenly distributed among different research groups. The reluctance in publishing code, data and models limits reproducibility and restricts evaluation to mono-institutional datasets. Summarised, deep learning will change positively the workflow of interventional radiotherapy but there is room for improvement when it comes to reproducible results and standardised evaluation methods.","Medical Physics, Machine Learning","27 September, 2022",2205.07516,10.1016/j.zemedi.2022.10.005,"@misc{2205.07516,

Optimal Needle Placement for Prostate Rotating-Shield Brachytherapy (RSBT),"Jirong Yi, Quentin E. Adams, Karolyn M. Hopfensperger, Ryan T. Flynn, Yusung Kim, John M. Buatti, Weiyu Xu, Xiaodong Wu","Purpose: To present an efficient NEEdle Position Optimization (NEEPO) algorithm for prostate rotating shield brachytherapy (RSBT). With RSBT, the increased flexibility beyond conventional high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) due to the partially shielded radiation source has been shown by Adams et al. in 2020 to enable improved urethra sparing (23.1%), enhanced dose escalation (29.9%), or both, with 20 needles without NEEPO-optimized positions. Within this regime of improved dosimetry, we propose in this work that the benefits of RSBT can be maintained while also reducing the number of needles needed for the delivery. The goal of NEEPO is to provide the capability to further increase the dosimetric benefit of RSBT and to minimize the number of needles needed to satisfy a dosimetric goal. Methods: The NEEPO algorithm generates a needle pool for a given patient and then iteratively constructs a subset of needles from the pool based on relative needle importance as determined by total dwell times within needles. The NEEPO algorithm is based on a convex optimization formulation using a quadratic dosimetric penalty function, dwell time regularization by total variation, and a block sparsity regularization term to enable iterative removal of low-importance needles.

Development and preclinical test of a 32P containing PEEK foil aiming at urethral stricture prevention by LDR brachytherapy,"Walter Assmann, Ricarda Becker, Christian Stief, Ronald Sroka","Purpose: Primary or recurrent urethral stenosis are a common clinical problem. The aim of this feasibility study was development and application test of a novel radioactive catheter for potential use in LDR brachytherapy to prevent urethral stenosis. Methods: A beta radiation emitting 32P-foil was developed and integrated in an indwelling catheter, which is usually inserted after surgical interventions in the urethra. Activity and dose distribution were measured after neutron activation of the 31P foil component with scintillation techniques as well as radiochromic films and compared to MC simulations. Practicability and radiation safety of this new applicator was tested on male rabbits, which underwent before catheter application a new method of stricture induction by radial laser light irradiation. Results: Measured dose distributions of catheters with 32P-foils were found in good agreement with MC simulations. Wash-out test confirmed the radioactive catheter setup to be inside the permitted limits of a sealed source. Strictures could be induced by laser light in all animals, surgically treated by slitting and irradiation with a 7-day dose of 15 Gy or 30 Gy without adverse radiation effects during 4 weeks observation time. Conclusions: This prove-of-concept study presents a save and technically uncomplicated approach of LDR brachytherapy intending to prevent urethral stenosis.

Validation of 4D Monte Carlo dose calculations using a programmable deformable lung phantom,"Sara Gholampourkashi, Joanna E. Cygler, Bernie Lavigne, Emily Heath","Purpose: To validate the accuracy of 4D Monte Carlo (4DMC) simulations to calculate dose deliveries to a deforming anatomy in the presence of realistic respiratory motion traces. A previously developed deformable lung phantom comprising an elastic tumor was modified to enable programming of arbitrary motion profiles. 4D simulations of the dose delivered to the phantom were compared with the measurements. Methods: The deformable lung phantom moving with irregular breathing patterns was irradiated using static and VMAT beam deliveries. Using the RADPOS 4D dosimetry system, point doses were measured inside and outside the tumor. Dose profiles were acquired using films along the motion path of the tumor (S-I). In addition to dose measurements, RADPOS was used to record the motion of the tumor during dose deliveries. Dose measurements were then compared against 4DMC simulations with EGSnrc/4DdefDOSXYZnrc using the recorded tumor motion. Results: The agreements between dose profiles from measurements and simulations were determined to be within 2%/2 mm. Point dose agreements were within 2σ of experimental and/or positional/dose reading uncertainties. 4DMC simulations were shown to accurately predict the sensitivity of delivered dose to the starting phase of breathing motions. We have demonstrated that our 4DMC method, combined with RADPOS, can accurately simulate realistic dose deliveries to a deforming anatomy moving with realistic breathing traces.

Deep-Learning-based Fast and Accurate 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer,"Yuzhen Ding, Hongying Feng, Yunze Yang, Jason Holmes, Zhengliang Liu, David Liu, William W. Wong, Nathan Y. Yu, Terence T. Sio, Steven E. Schild, Baoxin Li, Wei Liu","Purpose: In some proton therapy facilities, patient alignment relies on two 2D orthogonal kV images, taken at fixed, oblique angles, as no 3D on-the-bed imaging is available. The visibility of the tumor in kV images is limited since the patient's 3D anatomy is projected onto a 2D plane, especially when the tumor is behind high-density structures such as bones. This can lead to large patient setup errors. A solution is to reconstruct the 3D CT image from the kV images obtained at the treatment isocenter in the treatment position.
  Methods: An asymmetric autoencoder-like network built with vision-transformer blocks was developed. The data was collected from 1 head and neck patient: 2 orthogonal kV images (1024x1024 voxels), 1 3D CT with padding (512x512x512) acquired from the in-room CT-on-rails before kVs were taken and 2 digitally-reconstructed-radiograph (DRR) images (512x512) based on the CT. We resampled kV images every 8 voxels and DRR and CT every 4 voxels, thus formed a dataset consisting of 262,144 samples, in which the images have a dimension of 128 for each direction. In training, both kV and DRR images were utilized, and the encoder was encouraged to learn the jointed feature map from both kV and DRR images. In testing, only independent kV images were used. The full-size synthetic CT (sCT) was achieved by concatenating the sCTs generated by the model according to their spatial information. The image quality of the synthetic CT (sCT) was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and per-voxel-absolute-CT-number-difference volume histogram (CDVH).
  Results: The model achieved a speed of 2.1s and a MAE of <40HU. The CDVH showed that <5% of the voxels had a per-voxel-absolute-CT-number-difference larger than 185 HU.

An approach to study recruitment/derecruitment dynamics in a patient-specific computational model of an injured human lung,"Carolin M. Geitner, Tobias Becher, Inéz Frerichs, Norbert Weiler, Jason H. T. Bates, Wolfgang A. Wall","We present a new approach for physics-based computational modeling of diseased human lungs. Our main object is the development of a model that takes the novel step of incorporating the dynamics of airway recruitment/de-recruitment into an anatomically accurate, spatially resolved model of respiratory system mechanics, and the relation of these dynamics to airway dimensions and the biophysical properties of the lining fluid. The importance of our approach is that it potentially allows for more accurate predictions of where mechanical stress foci arise in the lungs, since it is at these locations that injury is thought to arise and propagate from. We match the model to data from a patient with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) to demonstrate the potential of the model for revealing the underlying derangements in ARDS in a patient-specific manner. To achieve this, the specific geometry of the lung and its heterogeneous pattern of injury are extracted from medical CT images. The mechanical behavior of the model is tailored to the patient's respiratory mechanics using measured ventilation data. In retrospective simulations of various clinically performed, pressure-driven ventilation profiles, the model adequately reproduces clinical quantities measured in the patient such as tidal volume and change in pleural pressure. The model also exhibits physiologically reasonable lung recruitment dynamics and has the spatial resolution to allow the study of local mechanical quantities such as alveolar strains. This modeling approach advances our ability to perform patient-specific studies in silico, opening the way to personalized therapies that will optimize patient outcomes.","Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science, Biological Physics, Medical Physics, Tissues and Organs","9 May, 2023",2212.01114,,"@misc{2212.01114,

Extracting lung function-correlated information from CT-encoded static textures,"Yu-Hua Huang, Xinzhi Teng, Jiang Zhang, Zhi Chen, Zongrui Ma, Ge Ren, Feng-Ming, Kong, Jing Cai","The inherent characteristics of lung tissues, which are independent of breathing manoeuvre, may provide fundamental information on lung function. This paper attempted to study function-correlated lung textures and their spatial distribution from CT. 21 lung cancer patients with thoracic 4DCT scans, DTPA-SPECT ventilation images (V), and available pulmonary function test (PFT) measurements were collected. 79 radiomic features were included for analysis, and a sparse-to-fine strategy including subregional feature discovery and voxel-wise feature distribution study was carried out to identify the function-correlated radiomic features. At the subregion level, lung CT images were partitioned and labeled as defected/non-defected patches according to reference V. At the voxel-wise level, feature maps (FMs) of selected feature candidates were generated for each 4DCT phase. Quantitative metrics, including Spearman coefficient of correlation (SCC) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for FM-V spatial agreement assessments, intra-class coefficient of correlation (ICC) for FM robustness evaluations, and FM-PFT comparisons, were applied to validate the results. At the subregion level, eight function-correlated features were filtered out with medium-to-large statistical strength (effect size>0.330) to differentiate defected/non-defected lung regions. At the voxel-wise level, FMs of candidates yielded moderate-to-strong voxel-wise correlations with reference V. Among them, FMs of GLDM Dependence Non-uniformity showed the highest robust (ICC=0.96) spatial correlation, with median SCCs ranging from 0.54 to 0.59 throughout ten phases. Its phase-averaged FM achieved a median SCC of 0.60, the median DSC of 0.60/0.65 for high/low functional lung volumes, respectively, and the correlation of 0.646 between the spatially averaged feature values and PFT measurements.","Medical Physics, Image and Video Processing","29 October, 2022",2210.16514,,"@misc{2210.16514,

Using a two-step approach, the researchers discovered eight function-correlated features that could differentiate between defected and non-defected lung regions. The results suggest that these features show a strong correlation with lung function measurements and may provide valuable information on lung function."
Predicting successful clinical candidates for fiducial-free lung tumor tracking with a deep learning binary classification model,"Matthieu Lafrenière, Gilmer Valdes, Martina Descovich","Robotic radiosurgery allows for marker-less lung tumor tracking by detecting tumor density variations in 2D orthogonal X-ray images. The ability to detect and track a lung lesion depends on its size, density, and location, and has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The current method for identifying which patient can be successfully treated with fiducial-free lung tumor tracking is a time-consuming process named Lung Optimized Treatment (LOT) simulation. The process involves CT acquisition, generation of a simulation plan, creation of the patient breathing model, and execution of the simulation plan on the treatment delivery platform.
  The aim of the study is to develop a tool to enable binary classification of trackable and non-trackable lung tumors for automatic selection of optimal tracking methods for patient undergoing robotic radiosurgery without having to perform the LOT simulation.
  We developed a deep learning classification model and tested 5 different network architectures to classify lung cancer lesions from enhanced digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) generated from planning CTs. This study included 129 patients with single or multiple lesions, for a total of 144 lung lesions (n=115 trackable, n=29 untrackable). A total of 271 images were included in our analysis. We kept 80% of the images for training, 10% for validation, and the remaining 10% for testing.
  The binary classification accuracy reached 100% after training, both in the validation and the test set.

SUPER-IVIM-DC: Intra-voxel incoherent motion based Fetal lung maturity assessment from limited DWI data using supervised learning coupled with data-consistency,"Noam Korngut, Elad Rotman, Onur Afacan, Sila Kurugol, Yael Zaffrani-Reznikov, Shira Nemirovsky-Rotman, Simon Warfield, Moti Freiman","Intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) analysis of fetal lungs Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DWI) data shows potential in providing quantitative imaging bio-markers that reflect, indirectly, diffusion and pseudo-diffusion for non-invasive fetal lung maturation assessment. However, long acquisition times, due to the large number of different ``b-value'' images required for IVIM analysis, precluded clinical feasibility. We introduce SUPER-IVIM-DC a deep-neural-networks (DNN) approach which couples supervised loss with a data-consistency term to enable IVIM analysis of DWI data acquired with a limited number of b-values. We demonstrated the added-value of SUPER-IVIM-DC over both classical and recent DNN approaches for IVIM analysis through numerical simulations, healthy volunteer study, and IVIM analysis of fetal lung maturation from fetal DWI data. Our numerical simulations and healthy volunteer study show that SUPER-IVIM-DC estimates of the IVIM model parameters from limited DWI data had lower normalized root mean-squared error compared to previous DNN-based approaches. Further, SUPER-IVIM-DC estimates of the pseudo-diffusion fraction parameter from limited DWI data of fetal lungs correlate better with gestational age compared to both to classical and DNN-based approaches (0.555 vs. 0.463 and 0.310).

Initial non-invasive in vivo sensing of the lung using time domain diffuse optics,"Antonio Pifferi, Massimo Miniati, Andrea Farina, Sanathana Konugolu Venkata Sekar, Pranav Lanka, Alberto Dalla Mora, Paola Taroni","Non-invasive in vivo sensing of the lung with light would help diagnose and monitor pulmonary disorders (caused by e.g. COVID-19, emphysema, immature lung tissue in infants). We investigated the possibility to probe the lung with time domain diffuse optics, taking advantage of the increased depth (few cm) reached by photons detected after a long (few ns) propagation time. An initial study on 5 healthy volunteers included time-resolved broadband diffuse optical spectroscopy measurements at 3 cm source-detector distance over the 600-1100 nm range, and long-distance (6-9 cm) measurements at 820 nm performed during a breathing protocol. The interpretation of the in vivo data with a simplified homogeneous model yielded a maximum probing depth of 2.6-3.9 cm, suitable to reach the lung. Also, signal changes related to the inspiration act were observed, especially at high photon propagation times. Yet, intra- and inter-subject variability and inconsistencies, possibly alluring to competing scattering and absorption effects, prevented a simple interpretation.

Fluid registration between lung CT and stationary chest tomosynthesis images,"Lin Tian, Connor Puett, Peirong Liu, Zhengyang Shen, Stephen R. Aylward, Yueh Z. Lee, Marc Niethammer","Registration is widely used in image-guided therapy and image-guided surgery to estimate spatial correspondences between organs of interest between planning and treatment images. However, while high-quality computed tomography (CT) images are often available at planning time, limited angle acquisitions are frequently used during treatment because of radiation concerns or imaging time constraints. This requires algorithms to register CT images based on limited angle acquisitions. We, therefore, formulate a 3D/2D registration approach which infers a 3D deformation based on measured projections and digitally reconstructed radiographs of the CT. Most 3D/2D registration approaches use simple transformation models or require complex mathematical derivations to formulate the underlying optimization problem. Instead, our approach entirely relies on differentiable operations which can be combined with modern computational toolboxes supporting automatic differentiation. This then allows for rapid prototyping, integration with deep neural networks, and to support a variety of transformation models including fluid flow models. We demonstrate our approach for the registration between CT and stationary chest tomosynthesis (sDCT) images and show how it naturally leads to an iterative image reconstruction approach.","Image and Video Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Medical Physics","6 March, 2022",2203.04958,10.1007/978-3-030-59716-0_30,"@misc{2203.04958,

A novel unsupervised covid lung lesion segmentation based on the lung tissue identification,"Faeze Gholamian Khah, Samaneh Mostafapour, Seyedjafar Shojaerazavi, Nouraddin Abdi-Goushbolagh, Hossein Arabi","This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a novel unsupervised deep learning-based framework for automated infections lesion segmentation from CT images of Covid patients. In the first step, two residual networks were independently trained to identify the lung tissue for normal and Covid patients in a supervised manner. These two models, referred to as DL-Covid and DL-Norm for Covid-19 and normal patients, respectively, generate the voxel-wise probability maps for lung tissue identification. To detect Covid lesions, the CT image of the Covid patient is processed by the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models to obtain two lung probability maps. Since the DL-Norm model is not familiar with Covid infections within the lung, this model would assign lower probabilities to the lesions than the DL-Covid. Hence, the probability maps of the Covid infections could be generated through the subtraction of the two lung probability maps obtained from the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models. Manual lesion segmentation of 50 Covid-19 CT images was used to assess the accuracy of the unsupervised lesion segmentation approach. The Dice coefficients of 0.985 and 0.978 were achieved for the lung segmentation of normal and Covid patients in the external validation dataset, respectively. Quantitative results of infection segmentation by the proposed unsupervised method showed the Dice coefficient and Jaccard index of 0.67 and 0.60, respectively. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed unsupervised approach for Covid-19 infectious lesion segmentation showed relatively satisfactory results.

Measurement and Analysis of Lobar Lung Deformation After a Change of Patient Position During Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery,"Pablo Alvarez, Matthieu Chabanas, Stéphane Sikora, Simon Rouzé, Yohan Payan, Jean-Louis Dillenseger","Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a minimally invasive surgical technique for the diagnosis and treatment of early-stage lung cancer. During VATS, large lung deformation occurs as a result of a change of patient position and a pneumothorax (lung deflation), which hinders the intraoperative localization of pulmonary nodules. Modeling lung deformation during VATS for surgical navigation is desirable, but the mechanisms causing such deformation are yet not well-understood. In this study, we estimate, quantify and analyze the lung deformation occurring after a change of patient position during VATS. We used deformable image registration to estimate the lung deformation between a preoperative CT (in supine position) and an intraoperative CBCT (in lateral decubitus position) of six VATS clinical cases. We accounted for sliding motion between lobes and against the thoracic wall and obtained consistently low average target registration errors (under 1 mm). We observed large lung displacement (up to 40 mm); considerable sliding motion between lobes and against the thoracic wall (up to 30 mm); and localized volume changes indicating deformation. These findings demonstrate the complexity of the change of patient position phenomenon, which should necessarily be taken into account to model lung deformation for intraoperative guidance during VATS.",Medical Physics,"7 October, 2022",2202.14001,10.1109/TBME.2022.3205458,"@misc{2202.14001,

We propose AirQuant, an automated computational pipeline that systematically parcellates the airway tree into its lobes and generational branches from a deep learning based airway segmentation, deriving airway structural measures from chest CT. Importantly, AirQuant prevents the occurrence of spurious airway branches by thick wave propagation and removes loops in the airway-tree by graph search, overcoming limitations of existing airway skeletonisation algorithms. Tapering between airway segments (intertapering) and airway tortuosity computed by AirQuant were compared between 14 healthy participants and 14 IPF patients. Airway intertapering was significantly reduced in IPF patients, and airway tortuosity was significantly increased when compared to healthy controls. Differences were most marked in the lower lobes, conforming to the typical distribution of IPF-related damage. AirQuant is an open-source pipeline that avoids limitations of existing airway quantification algorithms and has clinical interpretability.

  Methods: Lung lobes of 250 publicly accessible CT datasets of adults were segmented with an open-source CT-specific algorithm. To match 2D ufSSFP MRI data of pediatric patients, both CT data and segmentations were translated into pseudo-MR images, masked to suppress anatomy outside the lung. Network-1 was trained with pseudo-MR images and lobe segmentations, and applied to 1000 masked ufSSFP images to predict lobe segmentations. These outputs were directly used as targets to train Network-2 and Network-3 with non-masked ufSSFP data as inputs, and an additional whole-lung mask as input for Network-2. Network predictions were compared to reference manual lobe segmentations of ufSSFP data in twenty pediatric cystic fibrosis patients. Manual lobe segmentations were performed by splitting available whole-lung segmentations into lobes.
  Results: Network-1 was able to segment the lobes of ufSSFP images, and Network-2 and Network-3 further increased segmentation accuracy and robustness. The average all-lobe Dice similarity coefficients were 95.0$\pm$2.8 (mean$\pm$pooled SD [%]), 96.4$\pm$2.0, 93.0$\pm$2.0, and the average median Hausdorff distances were 6.1$\pm$0.9 (mean$\pm$SD [mm]), 5.3$\pm$1.1, 7.1$\pm$1.3, for Network-1, Network-2, and Network-3, respectively.

Optimal efficiency of high frequency chest wall oscillations and links with resistance and compliance in a model of the lung,"Michaël Brunengo, Barrett R. Mitchell, Antonello Nicolini, Bernard Rousselet, Benjamin Mauroy","Chest physiotherapy is a set of techniques used to help the draining of the mucus from the lung in pathological situations. The choice of the techniques, and their adjustment to the patients or to the pathologies, remains as of today largely empirical. High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO) is one of these techniques, performed with a device that applies oscillating pressures on the chest. However, there is no clear understanding of how HFCWO devices interact with the lung biomechanics. Hence, we study idealised HFCWO manipulations applied to a mathematical and numerical model of the biomechanics of the lung. The lung is represented by a fluid--structure interaction model based on an airway tree that is coupled to an homogeneous elastic medium. We show that our model is driven by two dimensionless numbers that drive the effect of the idealised HFCWO manipulation on the model of the lung. Our model allow to analyze the stress applied to an idealised mucus by the air--mucus interaction and by the airway walls deformation. This stress behaves as a buffer and has the effect of reducing the stress needed to overcome the idealised mucus yield stress. Moreover, our model predicts the existence of an optimal range of the working frequencies of HFCWO. This range is in agreement with the frequencies actually used by practitioners during HFCWO maneuvers. Finally, our model suggests that analyzing the mouth airflow during HFCWO maneuvers could allow to estimate the compliance and the hydrodynamic resistance of the lung of a patient.","Medical Physics, Computational Physics, Tissues and Organs","26 November, 2021",2108.02437,10.1063/5.0073842,"@misc{2108.02437,

Quantification of lung function on CT images based on pulmonary radiomic filtering,"Zhenyu Yang, Kyle J Lafata, Xinru Chen, James Bowsher, Yushi Chang, Chunhao Wang, Fang-Fang Yin","Purpose: To develop a radiomics filtering technique for characterizing spatial-encoded regional pulmonary ventilation information on lung CT. Methods: The lung volume was segmented on 46 CT images, and a 3D sliding window kernel was implemented across the lung volume to capture the spatial-encoded image information. Fifty-three radiomic features were extracted within the kernel, resulting in a 4th order tensor object. As such, each voxel coordinate of the original lung was represented as a 53-dimensional feature vector, such that radiomic features could be viewed as feature maps within the lungs. To test the technique as a potential pulmonary ventilation biomarker, the radiomic feature maps were compared to paired functional images (Galligas PET or DTPA-SPECT) based on Spearman correlation (r) analysis. Results: The radiomic feature map GLRLM-based Run-Length Non-Uniformity and GLCOM-based Sum Average are found to be highly correlated with the functional imaging. The achieved r (median [range]) for the two features are 0.46 [0.05, 0.67] and 0.45 [0.21, 0.65] across 46 patients and 2 functional imaging modalities, respectively.

Variations of the relative biological effectiveness with fractionation in proton therapy: analysis of prostate cancer response,"Juan Pardo-Montero, Miguel Pombar, Antonio Gómez-Caamaño, Simona Giordanengo, Isabel González-Crespo","Purpose: To present a methodology to analyze the variation of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) with fractionation from clinical data of tumor control probability (TCP) and to apply it to study the response of prostate cancer to proton therapy.
  Methods: We have analyzed the dependence of the RBE on the dose per fraction by using the LQ model and the Poisson TCP formalism. Experimental TCPs for prostate cancer (low risk, LR, and intermediate risk, IR) treated with photon and proton therapy for conventional fractionation (2 GyE$\times$37 fractions), moderate hypofractionation (3 GyE$\times$20 fractions) and hypofractionation (7.25 GyE$\times$5 fractions) were obtained from the literature and analyzed.
  Results: The dependence of the RBE on the dose per fraction presents three theoretical regions, with RBE monotonically decreasing, increasing or constant with the dose per fraction, depending on the change of ($α$, $β$) values between photon and proton irradiation (the equilibrium point being at ($α_p$/$β_p$)=($α_X$/$β_X$)($α_X$/$α_p$)). An analysis of the clinical data shows RBE values that decline with increasing dose per fraction: for LR RBE=1.124, 1.119, and 1.102 for 1.82 Gy, 2.73 Gy and 6.59 Gy per fraction (proton doses), respectively; for IR RBE=1.119, and 1.102 for 1.82 Gy, and 6.59 Gy per fraction, respectively.
  Conclusions: Our analysis shows a monotonically decreasing RBE with increasing dose per fraction for prostate cancer, which is expected from the LQ formalism and the changes in ($α$, $β$) between photon and proton irradiation. However, due to the limited number of schedules and patients per schedule, the observed decrease of RBE with increasing dose is not significant for LR prostate cancer. For IR prostate cancer, the RBE obtained at 7.25 GyE seems to be significantly lower than that obtained at 2 GyE.",Medical Physics,"16 March, 2023",2303.09485,,"@misc{2303.09485,

Quasi-Real Time Multi-Frequency 3D Shear Wave Absolute Vibro-Elastography (S-WAVE) System for Prostate,"Tajwar Abrar Aleef, Julio Lobo, Ali Baghani, Hani Eskandari, Hamid Moradi, Robert Rohling, S. Larry Goldenberg, William James Morris, S. Sara Mahdavi, Septimiu E. Salcudean","This article describes a novel quasi-real time system for quantitative and volumetric measurement of tissue elasticity in the prostate. Tissue elasticity is computed by using a local frequency estimator to measure the three dimensional local wavelengths of a steady-state shear wave within the prostate gland. The shear wave is created using a mechanical voice coil shaker which transmits multi-frequency vibrations transperineally. Radio frequency data is streamed directly from a BK Medical 8848 trans-rectal ultrasound transducer to an external computer where tissue displacement due to the excitation is measured using a speckle tracking algorithm. Bandpass sampling is used that eliminates the need for an ultra fast frame rate to track the tissue motion and allows for accurate reconstruction at a sampling frequency that is below the Nyquist rate. A roll motor with computer control is used to rotate the sagittal array of the transducer and obtain the 3D data. Two CIRS phantoms were used to validate both the accuracy of the elasticity measurement as well as the functional feasibility of using the system for in vivo prostate imaging. The system has been used in two separate clinical studies as a method for cancer identification. The results, presented here, show numerical and visual correlations between our stiffness measurements and cancer likelihood as determined from pathology results. Initial published results using this system include an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82+/-0.01 with regards to prostate cancer identification in the peripheral zone.","Medical Physics, Signal Processing","9 May, 2022",2205.04038,,"@misc{2205.04038,

However, analyzing these images is complex even for experts, hence opening an opportunity for computer-aided diagnosis systems to seize. This paper proposes a fully automatic system based on Deep Learning that takes a prostate mpMRI from a PCa-suspect patient and, by leveraging the Retina U-Net detection framework, locates PCa lesions, segments them, and predicts their most likely Gleason grade group (GGG). It uses 490 mpMRIs for training/validation, and 75 patients for testing from two different datasets: ProstateX and IVO (Valencia Oncology Institute Foundation). In the test set, it achieves an excellent lesion-level AUC/sensitivity/specificity for the GGG$\geq$2 significance criterion of 0.96/1.00/0.79 for the ProstateX dataset, and 0.95/1.00/0.80 for the IVO dataset. Evaluated at a patient level, the results are 0.87/1.00/0.375 in ProstateX, and 0.91/1.00/0.762 in IVO. Furthermore, on the online ProstateX grand challenge, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (0.87 when trained only on the ProstateX data, tying up with the original winner of the challenge). For expert comparison, IVO radiologist's PI-RADS 4 sensitivity/specificity were 0.88/0.56 at a lesion level, and 0.85/0.58 at a patient level. Additional subsystems for automatic prostate zonal segmentation and mpMRI non-rigid sequence registration were also employed to produce the final fully automated system.

Head -and- neck multi-channel B1+ mapping and carotid arteries RF shimming using a parallel transmit head coil,"Matthijs H. S. de Buck, Peter Jezzard, Aaron T. Hess","Purpose: Neurovascular MRI suffers from a rapid drop in B1+ into the neck when using transmit head coils at 7T. One solution to improving B1+ magnitude in the major feeding arteries in the neck is to use custom RF shims on parallel transmit (pTx) head coils. However, calculating such shims requires robust multi-channel B1+ maps in both the head and the neck, which is challenging due to low RF penetration into the neck, limited dynamic range of multi-channel B1+ mapping techniques, and B0 sensitivity. We therefore sought a robust large-dynamic-range pTx field mapping protocol, and tested whether RF shimming can improve carotid artery B1+ in practice.
  Methods: A pipeline is presented that combines B1+ mapping data acquired using circularly polarized (CP-) and CP2-mode RF shims at multiple voltages. The pipeline was evaluated by comparing the predicted and measured B1+ for multiple random transmit shims, and by assessing the ability of RF shimming to increase the B1+ in the carotid arteries.
  Results: The proposed method achieved good agreement between predicted and measured B1+ in both the head and the neck. The B1+ magnitude in the carotid arteries can be increased by 42% using tailored RF shims or by 37% using universal RF shims, while also improving the RF homogeneity compared to CP mode.
  Conclusion: B1+ in the neck can be increased using RF shims calculated from multi-channel B1+ maps in both the head and the neck. This can be achieved using universal phase-only RF shims, facilitating easy implementation in existing sequences.",Medical Physics,"30 December, 2022",2212.14596,,"@misc{2212.14596,

Towards reliable head and neck cancers locoregional recurrence prediction using delta-radiomics and learning with rejection option,"Kai Wang, Michael Dohopolski, Qiongwen Zhang, David Sher, Jing Wang","A reliable locoregional recurrence (LRR) prediction model is important for the personalized management of head and neck cancers (HNC) patients. This work aims to develop a delta-radiomics feature-based multi-classifier, multi-objective, and multi-modality (Delta-mCOM) model for post-treatment HNC LRR prediction and adopting a learning with rejection option (LRO) strategy to boost the prediction reliability by rejecting samples with high prediction uncertainties. In this retrospective study, we collected PET/CT image and clinical data from 224 HNC patients. We calculated the differences between radiomics features extracted from PET/CT images acquired before and after radiotherapy as the input features. Using clinical parameters, PET and CT radiomics features, we built and optimized three separate single-modality models. We used multiple classifiers for model construction and employed sensitivity and specificity simultaneously as the training objectives. For testing samples, we fused the output probabilities from all these single-modality models to obtain the final output probabilities of the Delta-mCOM model. In the LRO strategy, we estimated the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties when predicting with Delta-mCOM model and identified patients associated with prediction of higher reliability. Predictions with higher epistemic uncertainty or higher aleatoric uncertainty than given thresholds were deemed unreliable, and they were rejected before providing a final prediction. Different thresholds corresponding to different low-reliability prediction rejection ratios were applied. The inclusion of the delta-radiomics feature improved the accuracy of HNC LRR prediction, and the proposed Delta-mCOM model can give more reliable predictions by rejecting predictions for samples of high uncertainty using the LRO strategy.","Medical Physics, Image and Video Processing","30 August, 2022",2208.14452,10.1002/mp.16132,"@misc{2208.14452,

Would the advances in pencil beam scanning and robotics make gantry-less treatment possible? In this study, we explore if high-quality treatment plans can be obtained without a gantry.
  We recently showed that proton treatments with the patient in an upright position may be feasible with a new soft robotic immobilization device and imaging which enables multiple possible patient orientations during a treatment. In this study, we evaluate if this new treatment geometry could enable high quality treatment plans without a gantry. We created pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment plans for seven patients with head-and-neck or brain tumors. Each patient was planned with two scenarios: one with a gantry with the patient in supine position and the other with a gantry-less fixed horizontal beam-line with the patient sitting upright.

  Most of the PBS-gantry-less plans had similar target HI and OAR mean dose as compared to PBS-gantry plans, and similar robustness with respect to range uncertainties and setup errors.

Comprehensive and Clinically Accurate Head and Neck Organs at Risk Delineation via Stratified Deep Learning: A Large-scale Multi-Institutional Study,"Dazhou Guo, Jia Ge, Xianghua Ye, Senxiang Yan, Yi Xin, Yuchen Song, Bing-shen Huang, Tsung-Min Hung, Zhuotun Zhu, Ling Peng, Yanping Ren, Rui Liu, Gong Zhang, Mengyuan Mao, Xiaohua Chen, Zhongjie Lu, Wenxiang Li, Yuzhen Chen, Lingyun Huang, Jing Xiao, Adam P. Harrison, Le Lu, Chien-Yu Lin, Dakai Jin, Tsung-Ying Ho","Accurate organ at risk (OAR) segmentation is critical to reduce the radiotherapy post-treatment complications. Consensus guidelines recommend a set of more than 40 OARs in the head and neck (H&N) region, however, due to the predictable prohibitive labor-cost of this task, most institutions choose a substantially simplified protocol by delineating a smaller subset of OARs and neglecting the dose distributions associated with other OARs. In this work we propose a novel, automated and highly effective stratified OAR segmentation (SOARS) system using deep learning to precisely delineate a comprehensive set of 42 H&N OARs. SOARS stratifies 42 OARs into anchor, mid-level, and small & hard subcategories, with specifically derived neural network architectures for each category by neural architecture search (NAS) principles. We built SOARS models using 176 training patients in an internal institution and independently evaluated on 1327 external patients across six different institutions. It consistently outperformed other state-of-the-art methods by at least 3-5% in Dice score for each institutional evaluation (up to 36% relative error reduction in other metrics). More importantly, extensive multi-user studies evidently demonstrated that 98% of the SOARS predictions need only very minor or no revisions for direct clinical acceptance (saving 90% radiation oncologists workload), and their segmentation and dosimetric accuracy are within or smaller than the inter-user variation. These findings confirmed the strong clinical applicability of SOARS for the OAR delineation process in H&N cancer radiotherapy workflows, with improved efficiency, comprehensiveness, and quality.","Image and Video Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Medical Physics","1 November, 2021",2111.01544,,"@misc{2111.01544,

OARnet: Automated organs-at-risk delineation in Head and Neck CT images,"Mumtaz Hussain Soomro, Hamidreza Nourzadeh, Victor Gabriel Leandro Alves, Wookjin Choi, Jeffrey V. Siebers","A 3D deep learning model (OARnet) is developed and used to delineate 28 H&N OARs on CT images. OARnet utilizes a densely connected network to detect the OAR bounding-box, then delineates the OAR within the box. It reuses information from any layer to subsequent layers and uses skip connections to combine information from different dense block levels to progressively improve delineation accuracy. Training uses up to 28 expert manual delineated (MD) OARs from 165 CTs. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) with respect to MD is assessed for 70 other CTs. Mean, maximum, and root-mean-square dose differences with respect to MD are assessed for 56 of the 70 CTs. OARnet is compared with UaNet, AnatomyNet, and Multi-Atlas Segmentation (MAS). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests using 95% confidence intervals are used to assess significance. Wilcoxon signed ranked tests show that, compared with UaNet, OARnet improves (p<0.05) the DSC (23/28 OARs) and HD95 (17/28). OARnet outperforms both AnatomyNet and MAS for DSC (28/28) and HD95 (27/28). Compared with UaNet, OARnet improves median DSC up to 0.05 and HD95 up to 1.5mm. Compared with AnatomyNet and MAS, OARnet improves median (DSC, HD95) by up to (0.08, 2.7mm) and (0.17, 6.3mm).

In the proposed 3D FEM, nonlinear Ogden hyper-elastic material model describes axons and ECM materials. The modeled bi-phasic RVEs have axons tied to surrounding matrix. In this proof-of-concept (POC) FEM, three simple shear loading configurations and a pure shear scenario were simulated. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) were computed for stress and deformation response plots to depict role of axon-ECM orientations & loading condition on the Poynting effect. Variations in normal stresses (S11, S22, or S33) perpendicular to the shear plane emphasized role of fiber-matrix interactions. At high strains, the stress-strain% plots also indicated modest strain stiffening effects and bending stresses in purely sheared axons.","Medical Physics, Soft Condensed Matter, Tissues and Organs","1 May, 2023",2305.01131,,"@misc{2305.01131,

We used an eye-tracking functional eye camera (FEC) compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for measuring eye surface pulsations. Special optics enabled the integration of the FEC with a magnetic resonance compatible video ophthalmoscopy (MRcVO) for simultaneous retinal imaging along with functional eye MRI imaging (fMREye) reflecting BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) contrast. Upon optimizing the fMREye parameters, we thus measured the power of the physiological (vasomotor, respiratory, and cardiac) eye and brain pulsations by fast Fourier transform (FFT) power analysis. The human eye proved to pulsate in all three physiological pulse bands, most prominently in the respiratory (RESP) band. The FFT power means of physiological pulsation for two adjacent slices was significantly higher than in one-slice scans (RESP1 .vs RESP2; df = 5, p = 0.0174). FEC and MRcVO confirmed the respiratory pulsations at the eye surface and retina. we conclude that the human eye has three pulsation mechanisms, and multimodal imaging offers non-invasive monitoring of their effects in driving eye fluidics.",Medical Physics,"25 April, 2023",2304.12629,,"@misc{2304.12629,

Towards Realistic Ultrasound Fetal Brain Imaging Synthesis,"Michelle Iskandar, Harvey Mannering, Zhanxiang Sun, Jacqueline Matthew, Hamideh Kerdegari, Laura Peralta, Miguel Xochicale","Prenatal ultrasound imaging is the first-choice modality to assess fetal health. Medical image datasets for AI and ML methods must be diverse (i.e. diagnoses, diseases, pathologies, scanners, demographics, etc), however there are few public ultrasound fetal imaging datasets due to insufficient amounts of clinical data, patient privacy, rare occurrence of abnormalities in general practice, and limited experts for data collection and validation. To address such data scarcity, we proposed generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based models, diffusion-super-resolution-GAN and transformer-based-GAN, to synthesise images of fetal ultrasound brain planes from one public dataset. We reported that GAN-based methods can generate 256x256 pixel size of fetal ultrasound trans-cerebellum brain image plane with stable training losses, resulting in lower FID values for diffusion-super-resolution-GAN (average 7.04 and lower FID 5.09 at epoch 10) than the FID values of transformer-based-GAN (average 36.02 and lower 28.93 at epoch 60). The results of this work illustrate the potential of GAN-based methods to synthesise realistic high-resolution ultrasound images, leading to future work with other fetal brain planes, anatomies, devices and the need of a pool of experts to evaluate synthesised images.

Diffusion MRI with free gradient waveforms on a high-performance gradient system: Probing restriction and exchange in the human brain,"Arthur Chakwizira, Ante Zhu, Thomas Foo, Carl-Fredrik Westin, Filip Szczepankiewicz, Markus Nilsson","The dependence of the diffusion MRI signal on the diffusion time carries signatures of restricted diffusion and exchange. Here we seek to highlight these signatures in the human brain by performing experiments using free gradient waveforms that are selectively sensitive to the two effects. We examine six healthy volunteers using both strong and ultra-strong gradients (80, 200 and 300 mT/m). In an experiment featuring a large set of gradient waveforms with different sensitivities to restricted diffusion and exchange (150 samples), our results reveal unique time-dependence signatures in grey and white matter, where the former is characterised by both restricted diffusion and exchange and the latter predominantly exhibits restricted diffusion. Furthermore, we show that gradient waveforms with independently varying sensitivities to restricted diffusion and exchange can be used to map exchange in the human brain. We consistently find that exchange in grey matter is at least twice as fast as in white matter, across all subjects and all gradient strengths. The shortest exchange times observed in this study were in the cerebellar cortex (115 ms). We also assess the feasibility of future clinical applications of the method used in this work, where we find that the grey-white matter exchange contrast obtained with a 25-minute 300 mT/m protocol is preserved by a 4-minute 300 mT/m and a 10-minute 80 mT/m protocol.

Exploring contrast generalisation in deep learning-based brain MRI-to-CT synthesis,"Lotte Nijskens, Cornelis, AT van den Berg, Joost JC Verhoeff, Matteo Maspero","Background: Synthetic computed tomography (sCT) has been proposed and increasingly clinically adopted to enable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiotherapy. Deep learning (DL) has recently demonstrated the ability to generate accurate sCT from fixed MRI acquisitions. However, MRI protocols may change over time or differ between centres resulting in low-quality sCT due to poor model generalisation. Purpose: investigating domain randomisation (DR) to increase the generalisation of a DL model for brain sCT generation. Methods: CT and corresponding T1-weighted MRI with/without contrast, T2-weighted, and FLAIR MRI from 95 patients undergoing RT were collected, considering FLAIR the unseen sequence where to investigate generalisation. A ``Baseline'' generative adversarial network was trained with/without the FLAIR sequence to test how a model performs without DR. Image similarity and accuracy of sCT-based dose plans were assessed against CT to select the best-performing DR approach against the Baseline. Results: The Baseline model had the poorest performance on FLAIR, with mean absolute error (MAE)=106$\pm$20.7 HU (mean$\pmσ$). Performance on FLAIR significantly improved for the DR model with MAE=99.0$\pm$14.9 HU, but still inferior to the performance of the Baseline+FLAIR model (MAE=72.6$\pm$10.1 HU). Similarly, an improvement in $γ$-pass rate was obtained for DR vs Baseline. Conclusions: DR improved image similarity and dose accuracy on the unseen sequence compared to training only on acquired MRI. DR makes the model more robust, reducing the need for re-training when applying a model on sequences unseen and unavailable for retraining.","Medical Physics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning","17 March, 2023",2303.10202,,"@misc{2303.10202,

"A finite rotation, small strain 2D elastic head model, with applications in mild traumatic brain injury","Yang Wan, Wenqiang Fang, Rika Wright Carlsen, Haneesh Kesari","Rotational head motions have been shown to play a key role in traumatic brain injury. There is great interest in developing methods to rapidly predict brain tissue strains and strain rates resulting from rotational head motions to estimate brain injury risk and to guide the design of protective equipment. Idealized continuum mechanics based head models provide an attractive approach for rapidly estimating brain strains and strain rates. These models are capable of capturing the wave dynamics and transient response of the brain while being significantly easier and faster to apply compared to more sophisticated and detailed finite element head models. In this work, we present a new idealized continuum mechanics based head model that accounts for the head's finite rotation, which is an improvement upon prior models that have been based on a small rotation assumption. Despite the simplicity of the model, we show that the proposed 2D elastic finite rotation head model predicts comparable strains to a more detailed finite element head model, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the model in rapidly estimating brain injury risk.

On multi-path longitudinal spin relaxation in brain tissue,"Jakob Assländer, Andrew Mao, Erin S Beck, Francesco La Rosa, Robert W Charlson, Timothy M Shepherd, Sebastian Flassbeck","The purpose of this paper is to confirm previous reports that identified magnetization transfer (MT) as an inherent driver of longitudinal relaxation in brain tissue by asserting a substantial difference between the $T_1$ relaxation times of the free and the semi-solid spin pools. Further, we aim to identify an avenue towards the quantification of these relaxation processes on a voxel-by-voxel basis in a clinical imaging setting, i.e. with a nominal resolution of 1mm isotropic and full brain coverage in 12min. To this end, we optimized a hybrid-state pulse sequence for mapping the parameters of an unconstrained MT model. We scanned 4 people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and 4 healthy controls with this pulse sequence and estimated $T_1^f \approx 1.90$s and $T_1^s \approx 0.327$s for the free and semi-solid spin pool of healthy WM, respectively, confirming previous reports and questioning the commonly used assumptions $T_1^s = T_1^f$ or $T_1^s = 1$s. Further, we estimated a fractional size of the semi-solid spin pool of $m_0^s \approx 0.202$, which is larger than previously assumed. An analysis of $T_1^f$ in normal appearing white matter revealed statistically significant differences between individuals with MS and controls. In conclusion, we confirm that longitudinal spin relaxation in brain tissue is dominated by MT and that the hybrid state facilitates a voxel-wise fit of the unconstrained MT model, which enables the analysis of subtle neurodegeneration.","Medical Physics, Biological Physics","19 January, 2023",2301.08394,,"@misc{2301.08394,
