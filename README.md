## Introduction

Radiation Oncology NLP Database aims to provide a comprehensive dataset for natural language processing tasks related to radiation oncology. It has been specifically designed to cover a wide range of topics and tasks to enable researchers to develop Radiation-Oncology centered language models and test NLP algorithms/methods on domain-specific data.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset covers the following NLP tasks:

1. **Logic Reasoning**  
   *Last Update: now*
   
   This task focuses on the ability to reason logically about radiation oncology concepts and cases. It includes complex and multi-step reasoning challenges, as well as simpler deductions.

2. **Text Classification**  
   *Last Update: 4 minutes ago*
   
   This task involves classifying text data into predefined categories. It covers various aspects of radiation oncology, such as treatment planning, side effects, and more.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
   *Last Update: now*
   
   This task aims to identify and categorize specific entities, such as anatomical structures, radiation doses, and other relevant concepts in radiation oncology.

4. **Question and Answering (QA)**  
   *Last Update: now*
   
   This task focuses on the ability to provide concise and accurate answers to questions related to radiation oncology.

5. **Text Summarization**  
   *Last Update: now*
   
   This task involves creating concise and informative summaries of lengthy documents and research papers related to radiation oncology.
